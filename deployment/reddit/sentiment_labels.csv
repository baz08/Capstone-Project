#### Decentralization isnâ€™t the future â€”Â it is nowÂ Â 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Decentralized finance is an umbrella term encompassing the vision of a financial system that functions without any intermediaries, such as banks, insurances or other parties, and is operated just by the power of smart contracts. DeFi looks to bring the transparency and security of distributed financial technologies to traditional finance use cases, while reducing inefficiencies and solving pain points.  
&gt;  
&gt;So where did this idea of decentralized finance come from? Ethereum, an open-source software platform based on blockchain technology, allows developers and other tech teams to build decentralized financial products on it. Apart from their obvious use case as money, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and others can play a significant role in increasing global economic participation and protecting against government overreach.Â   
&gt;  
&gt;DeFi is opening investment opportunities for large populations who had previously been excluded from investing in financial markets. With more participants in the space â€” whether it be financial players, blockchain protocols, wallets, miners or exchanges â€”Â there is an opportunity to make financial opportunities more accessible to the underserved and unbanked. For example, in places with poor governance and authoritarianism, users can divest to the DeFi system to protect their wealth. Additionally, decentralized finance removes costly intermediaries to make remittance services more affordable for the global population.Â   
&gt;  
&gt;While DeFi may not yet be able to compete with centralized financial systems in terms of speed and usability, working applications are more secure, transparent, accessible and affordable than the systems we currently have. This type of structure provides wider access to financial services and anyone in the world can be a part of the blockchain regardless of wealth, location or status.Â Â 

&amp;#x200B;

#### A new way to operate financial systemsÂ 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\*2020 was a monumental year for DeFi and highlighted its revolutionary potential to reshape finance. By December, total value locked in decentralized finance applications exceeded $16 billion for the first time. As of April 2021, the total value locked (TVL) for DeFi now exceeds $40 billion. The growth shows the magnifying enthusiasm of traders to participate in this promising sector, who seek ways to grow their wealth on a global scale.Â   
&gt;  
&gt;The core values of decentralization and key technologies found in DeFi applications have already attracted some of the worldâ€™s largest centralized institutions including TD Ameritrade, Arca and CMT Digital. With continued adoption by larger agencies and with increased access to networks, profit margins will increase, and the business will grow around the hub.Â   
&gt;  
&gt;As we move forward through the year, weâ€™ll continue to see a melding of the old and new worlds of finance and traditional institutions will further dip their toes into the digital asset space. When they work together, we can look toward a more equitable and seamless world economy.\*

You have probably seen links to the [Poocoin App](https://poocoin.app/) come up in various pitches on this and other subs. In addition to having a continuously improving web app to view prices and track your wallet for BSC (Binance Smart Chain), there is a coin associated with the project ([Poocoin](https://poocoin.app/poocoin)) that I am extremely bullish on.

What problem is Poocoin solving?

Poocoin helps folks track BSC (Binance Smart Chain) wallets and understand how individual coins are trading. Given how high-risk and volatile crypto markets are, this is an incredibly important function â€“ and it hasnâ€™t surprised me to see links to poocoin charts popping up all over the place.

**A bit of background:** Right now there are two primary DEX (decentralized exchanges), and most of the coins youâ€™ll see here are traded on one of them. [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/) is used for trading coins against Ethereum (ETH), while [PancakeSwap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/) is used for trading coins against Binance Coin (BNB) â€“ projects on the latter are also referred to as Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

[Uni](https://info.uniswap.org/home) and [Pancake](https://pancakeswap.info/pairs) both have native analytics interfaces, but they are very limited in functionality, and Pancakeâ€™s significantly lags real-time trades. Additionally, they do not do a good job of showing price movement or individual transactions. For digging into individual transactions and wallets, [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) and [BSCScan](https://bscscan.com/) are great for research if you know what youâ€™re doing â€“ but itâ€™s hard to understand trends and see the bigger picture from there.

[Dextools](https://www.dextools.io/app/) has rightly emerged as the leading analytics / charting app for Uniswap, with great charts and individual transaction data. BSC / Pancake have been lacking a similarly high-functioning, fast, reliable solution. Poocoin provides that solution â€“ with charts, transaction tracking, wallet tracking, [Yield Farm tracking (Toilet feature)](https://poocoin.app/toilet) and more to come as driven by the community. I donâ€™t think the app is quite at the level of Dextools just yet in terms of features, but itâ€™s not far off and quickly improving as the community requests new features. Check out the [telegram](https://t.me/poocointokenchat) to see how it really is a community-driven project, with users requesting features and the lead developer responding in real-time.

The web app is cool but what does the token have to do with it and why should I buy it?

Unlike many projects which trade on the promise of future functionality (no shade, Iâ€™ve invested in many of these) â€“ poocoin began as a product first, with the token added in what seemed like an afterthought. The point was to create something useful for traders. More recently, the token has begun to play a bigger role in the ecosystem, including a new [premium tier](https://poocoin.app/premium) to track other wallets if you are pooling BNB / POO in the Pancake pool. I donâ€™t speak for the Poocoin creator, but I have spoken with them and I think that over time the coin itself will play a more important role in the ecosystem, for instance unlocking certain premium tracking / alerting features while retaining most of the functionality for all users / free.

On that topic, one thing that I love about this project is that the focus has been much more on building the community of users than extracting value by requiring people to hold or pay POO, so I think that most new features will continue to be available to all users. Itâ€™s also been almost completely organic growth to date, with people using the product and getting acquainted with the coin because of that â€“ as usage and the community grows, I believe the price of the coin will as well.

Tell me more about the tokenomics and how much upside potential this thing has?

**â€” Redistribution / deflationary mechanism.** 8% fee charged for each transaction, 4% distributed to token holders (in accordance to the size of their POO holdings), 4% burned. Seems like a lot of coins here recently have a deflationary / redistribution mechanism and I think for good reason. Transaction fee + redistribution incentivizes hodlers over swing traders, and youâ€™re able to increase your holdings simply by having the coin in your wallet (apart from price appreciation). And then the token burn deflates supply which creates upward pressure on the price over time. Additionally, no more than 100,000 can be traded in 1 transaction, meaning thereâ€™s a limit on huge whale buys / sells.

**â€” Itâ€™s still very early**. The initial supply was 10M POO. The total supply now (5pm Pacific on 3/13/21) is 6,839,793 with a price of around $0.30. Thatâ€™s a market cap of $2.05 M. Compare that to GoSwapp (BSC charting platform that people appear to be using significantly less than poocoin, at least the last few weeks) @ $36M (18x for Poocoin), Unidex (another BSC charting tool that poocoin has surpassed in functionality imo) @ $19M (9.5x for Poocoin), or DexTools at $151M (75x for Poocoin). **Comparables are always tough in crypto but Iâ€™m planning on hodling until at least $6 (20x current value)**.

**â€“ No presale and distribution of holders has grown less concentrated over time.** As described in this excellent [moonshots 101](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mbdlil/cryptomoonshots_101/), a presale is often (not always imo) an indicator that there are a lot of large holders looking to make a quick buck who will sell off at the first sign of a peak. Poocoin had no presale; it simply launched on PancakeSwap. If youâ€™re buying in now, there are folks like me who bought in at a lower price (I got in around $0.10 and have been buying more gradually, including significantly more at the current price today). I canâ€™t speak for other holders, and of course there will be those who take some profits as price continues to rise. But I do get the sense from the community that a lot of people see the rare potential here and are looking to ride out the waves until it hits a large multiple of its current price before they consider selling.

**â€“ What about liquidity and volatility?** Liquidity was a significant concern for myself and many in the community for the past week or two. Currently, liquidity in Pancake sits at \~$120k (i.e. \~$60k worth of BNB and \~$60k worth of POO). More liquidity generally means less volatility (i.e. a given buy / sell has less price impact), and itâ€™s a generally a good thing for a coinâ€™s legitimacy. Realizing the liquidity issue, Poocoin added a [premium tier](https://poocoin.app/premium) accessible via being a liquidity provider. As a result, there has been a sizable increase in liquidity over the past few days (currently \~$120k in the pool) although I'd like to see it go significantly higher still â€“ given the responsiveness of the team to this issue, Iâ€™m confident liquidity will continue to increase.

**â€“ Sounds good but whatâ€™s with the name? Are you really comparing a coin called Poocoin to DexTools?** When I bought in, I found the name amusing, but growth-wise I saw it as maybe a good thing (meme potential / funny) or maybe a bad thing (may prevent people from taking the project seriously). I could still go either way â€“ although I do like that it's a funny reference to the storm of shitcoins we are all in with some on-the-nose irony that this actually is **not** a no-utility shitcoin. Name aside, check out the community and use the product â€“ I'm confident this is the real deal.

**â€“ Okay but what if DexTools adds BSC or Unidex or Goswapp improve their features and surpass Poocoin?** If DexTools added BSC features tomorrow (they have not made any such announcements to my knowledge and if it happens, seems like it will be awhile), I think that would pose a modest risk for the Poocoin productâ€™s continual user growth. However, Poocoin really has added many features that rival DexTools, while adding unique features like the best Wallet Tracking Iâ€™ve experienced across any of these types of apps. DexTools and others also appear more keen to gate premium features with high subscription costs ([$75+ month](https://www.dextools.io/) for wallet tracking).

On Unidex / Goswapp, I think they will continue to improve their products (coin tracking / analytics is a huge space and there could be many successful projects), but Iâ€™ve been incredibly impressed with the pace of Pooâ€™s development and adoption relative to them â€“ and personally I think it's a much better product than those. **And again, those are currently 9.5 and 18x Pooâ€™s market cap!**

Aight, how do I buy this thing and join the community?

t3_mkncyt," I have just encountered a Bitcoin scam on a different level,  
that's not your typical seed theft by a fake wallet or phishing website,  
these guys went beyond what I have expected, let me walk you through:

The name of the site is **""**[**Bitmantic.com**](https://bitmantic.com/)**""**

1. The scam starts with an SMS message I got, stating the following:

*Hi Osnat, as requested, we did an untaxable deposit of about â‚¬471,000 into your bitcoin portfolio at Bitmantic.com UserId: 32576475 Pass: bigvon56*

( [https://imgur.com/a2sK4UD](https://imgur.com/a2sK4UD))

2. of course, I try to login out of curiosity to see how the scam works, I use the provided login details and sure it works.  
The page immediately asks to change my current password to a stronger one (at this stage I thought maybe they'll be phish my password and try their luck on some exchanges).  
( [https://imgur.com/yNFkwAE](https://imgur.com/yNFkwAE) )

3. I change the password and it even uses an OTP method of verification, I get an SMS with a code to prove my identity. (there I understood that this wasn't the regular scam we often see)  
( [https://imgur.com/Q6rZNnf](https://imgur.com/Q6rZNnf) )  
4. I open the account and there is indeed the 9.5 BTC balance, I browse through the website just to see how much they actually put into this, and I find that the site is well organized, all the buttons are clickable, there are **About, Privacy, terms of service** pages with actual content.

5. of course, I do what every normal person would do, and try to withdraw the BTC,  
I put my recipient address and I get an error message noting that the first withdrawal amount can't be above 0.00014 BTC (about $7) ""out of security reasons"",  
so sure I try to withdraw the max amount, and I get a confirmation of the site, (here I'm sure that nothing would really happen, and probably I will get a message requesting me to put my seeds to continue the process)

6. ***What happened now blew me away.***  
I get a confirmation on my **Binance** account that I have just deposited funds, and indeed my balance just increased by the $7 mentioned above. (**the scammers sent me the funds!!)**

7. Here is the catch, when I try to withdraw the rest 9.4... BTC that has left, I get a popup saying that I have a withdrawal **Min limit** of 9.5...BTC and basically I have to fund my account in order to continue. (Yea sure..) ( [https://imgur.com/EIXThbR](https://imgur.com/EIXThbR))

Please be **aware** and **share** this with your friends, anyone could fall for this out of pure greed.  
You don't usually see this level of commitment in these scams, these guys went beyond what we know, the website is clean and looks very professional and legit, they send you actual money to lure you in, and I'm sure the success rate is crazy here.  

The scam is based in **Israel** from what I can tell, or at least targets Israelis as the OTP asks for an Israeli number (maybe based on location), I can tell that just by the name ""Osnat"" as it is a common Israeli name and not mine...  
so Thank You for reading and please remember:

""***if something is too good to be true, it probably isn't***"".

On Monday 5th April 2021, the CEO of Smartlands answered questions at an AMA session on stellarbets

This post collects all of the questions and answers into an easy to ready format.

**Q1.** **Hey! Wondering if we could learn more about the expected launch date, and what to expect on that day you do launch?**

*We are planning to announce the launch date and the main stages of the project in a couple of days. In the same release, we will cover what to expect on the launch day, too. We have to sort the licensing first.*

**Q2. In 2020, researchers from Oxford University published a paper called** [**""Tokenization: The Future of Real Estate**]
The paper suggests that the future of tokenizing real estate looks ""promising,"" though it also listed a couple of challenges:**

**""First, there needs to be an expressed demand for the fractionalisation of single real estate assets. Evidence of this is at best sketchy, both through history and in the current period. Second, market participants need to be comfortable with blockchain, the digital underpinning of tokenisation.""**

**Do you view these as challenges, and if so, how is Smartlands working to overcome them in Ukraine?**

**Similarly, the researchers seemed very keen on the idea of tokenizing debt markets, calling it an area ""of significant promise."" Can you provide a rough idea of the opportunities within this space, and the hurdles that need to be overcome before Smartlands can take advantage of them?**

*Debt markets are certainly also interested, although in our opinion not so promising as equity. We plan to add debt opportunities on the platform after the launch, in about the 2nd half of 2021.*

*Regarding the challenges for the tokenization, we don't see the problems mentioned in the Oxford report in Ukraine. In our opinion, the biggest challenge is the integration of the tokenized assets into the existing capital markets ecosystem (listing on traditional stock exchanges, ability to put tokens into collateral in a bank, etc.) and that can be solved only with specific legislation, like the one that is coming in Ukraine.*

**Q3.** **After you launch in Ukraine, will you be expanding your product range eg Art or will you be targeting launching in the UK?**

*We're considering building several ""arms"" in our ecosystem - real estate, agriculture, art and collectibles, SMEs, and startups.*

*We will start our alternative investment platform slowly, with only real estate, but will gradually add other asset classes as the investment capacity grows.*

**Q4.** **At this point, can you give us more details about the expansion of the Agroxy platform?**

*After thorough planning with multiple stakeholders, we're moving towards a more close partnership with Agroxy, and building a comprehensive ecosystem for farmers, not only including trading of farm produces, but also investments, payments, etc. We can't disclose much around it, as the details are still being negotiated and we don't have approval from other stakeholders in the project, but we will update our community as soon as there will be a solid agreement.*

**Q5.** **What makes Smartlands better than any other platform trying to tokenize real-estate?**

*We're for a long time in this market and almost certainly have a level of expertise bigger than of any new platform. Besides that, we're uniquely positioned as not only a tech company with one of the best tokenization technology but also we're the first client of our own tech with the regulated alternative investment business.*

*And our business and plans are far bigger than just real assets tokenization, more towards the concept of investment banking. E.g. we not only tokenize and list, but attracting investments, and for some asset classes plan even to provide a closed comprehensive ecosystem (agriculture).*

**Q6. Will there be KYC requirements for staking SLT and are there going to be restrictions on who can stake as a result? (i.e New York where there are heavy financial regulations)?**

*I can't yet give a certain answer about NY, but our ultimate goal is to allow staking for every investor.*

*Investors will need to hold the staked tokens in the regulated environment (Smartlands wallet), and we plan to require KYC only for investments (however that might change as our legal team goes through all the questions).*

**Q7.** **Do you have any plans for marketing videos on YouTube that explains your product, fee structure and how the SLT utility token is used in your product for better transparency and user reach?**

*Smartlands Youtube channel will be active very soon, and we plan to build a solid presence here. With good quality content and speakers. Considering Russian and English-speaking audiences, and most probably will make the content for both.*

*Overall, video content gives a unique educational opportunity and this will be one of the most important arms in the marketing of alternative investments.*

**Q8.** **What is the status of the Smartlands Wallet? Will it be compatible with Ledger and Trezor?**

*Smartlands Wallet, as well as the whole platform, is currently under a major overhaul.*

*Although the tokenization core was built as state-of-the-art for our UK adventure, the UI/UX/visual part was under the acceptance threshold, and that's where we concentrated our efforts now. So expect to see a good-looking solid platform, combining all the components into a very sexy and convenient UI.*

*For the wallet part, we see the big potential in streamlining the user experience by allowing to sign in with email and password (similar to what StellarX provides), but hardware wallets will also be supported for the increased security.*

*Ledger wallet support should be ready immediately with the wallet launch (or a few weeks later), and Trezor support is in the backlog and will be available later, about Q3.*

**Q9.**  **I heard that there are around 5-6 million tokens that are being held off from the public, is this true, and if itâ€™s true do yâ€™all have any plans to gradually release them into the public or do you plan on just holding them?**

*The stats on CoinMarketCap are in general correct. There is \~7.1 million max supply, and \~5.5 circulating (was 5.1 prior to our investment into the Ukrainian licensed company). The number of tokens in circulation will be adjusted on the public release of the news regarding the status of our license in Ukraine.*

*All the company tokens are unlocked from the escrow contract according to the T&amp;C of the crowd sale (within 3 years), but we're planning to continue to hold them at least until we have a really solid natural demand for the token from multiple sources and jurisdictions.*

**Q10.**  **It is well known and understood that the first iteration of Smartlands and tokenization project in the UK could be seen as a pilot project of sorts. Brexit and the ultimate bear market forced a pivoting point in Smartlands - what are your two or three most important takeaways/lessons learned from that pilot project and how do you plan to implement these lessons within the framework of the platform launch in Ukraine?**

**Secondly, Do you see any barriers of entry beyond the legal and regulatory frameworks or hurdles? What do you feel is your biggest hurdle/most challenging barrier of entry ?**

**Thanks, with much love and belief in the project. We are rooting for you guys!**

*Thank you for the words of support; it meant a lot for the whole team! We certainly learned from the pilot and based on that knowledge, we are designing our alternative investment project now. The main takeaways are:*

*- We now more focus on the secondary market and an ability to put the tokens into collateral, as these turned to be the key points for institutionals;*

*- The retail audience we plan to target now is not the same. Previously we targeted crypto enthusiasts worldwide, and now the focus of the main campaign for the retail stage will be different. As in general crypto audience tends to trade and get the benefits now, we need those who prefer a long-term investment;*

*- We focus on the jurisdiction more friendly for tokenized real assets, as this allows to cut off the unnecessary middlemen, make tokens more transparent and secure, and allows streamlined integration into a traditional finance ecosystem.*

*The most significant barrier so far is still the regulation and waiting for the new law on digital assets to come into full force. However, as I told in the Sam Conner AMA, the process will be ""iterational"", and we will gradually release all the features.*

**Q11.** **What are some major roadblocks that could potentially hurt progress on the project? I always see people singing praises of SLT, but I get skeptical when there are only pros and no cons to discuss.**

**i.e. with the 1000â‚¬ requirement to stake, is there something that could impact a change to this plan for holders?**

*We don't foresee any significant roadblocks, but until the project is a successful and profitable global enterprise, all the startup risks are applied (however, to a major extent these risks are mitigated as we already are an experienced team and understand all the needs of the market).*

*Regarding the staking, we don't foresee any problems in implementing this rule, and holders will always be allowed to change the desired amount through on-chain voting.*

**Q12.** **Is there any news on when the Smartlands platform will go online?**

*soonâ„¢*  
 *:)*

**Q13.** **What is the biggest misinformation about Smartlands that you have seen?**

*Stolen logo :D*

**Q14.** **Can you maybe explain, in just a few simple sentences, how you ensure consistency between on-chain tokens and off-chain assets? I am thinking about some unexpected events that can befell on advertised buildings/properties (case of fire, earthquake, ...). How is this monitored and reflected on blockchain issued tokens?**

*Thanks for the question, it is really an important aspect.*

*Naturally, the equity tokens will provide all the same rights as the ""paper"" equity shares. That will be governed by the regulator and big partner banks and custodians.*

*Thus, the ownership of the property won't change in any event. And talking about the price of the tokens, it also shouldn't drop significantly, as the building naturally should be insured.*

**Q15.** **Who do you consider is our biggest competitor in this space and why?**

*There are a lot of DeFi projects, but I believe that we compete with the investments in general. We are trying to solve the issues of the current system and give people a cheaper, safe and more beneficial way to invest. Itâ€™s the best way to deliver some value. And if there are some similar projects, we are more than happy that this market is becoming more prominent and popular.*

**Q16.** **Are you at all concerned about the recent news of a Russian military presence pushing closer to Ukraine's border, and if so do you feel that Ukraine getting closer to a decentralized economy has anything to do with that?**

**Also, if someone wanted to get involved in helping the process of expanding Smartlands tokenization to new nations, such as Mexico, how would one go about that?**

**Also, will the staking minimum of 1000 euro be changed or clarified into a SLT balance?**

*Thank for the questions!*  


1. *The Ukraine-Russian relationship, Itâ€™s the same as global warming; we canâ€™t change it at once, but we are taking all possible measures in order to prevent future problems. Our platform is safe and eco-friendly :)*
2. *Expansion  - we're currently concentrating our own business activities around Ukraine, Liechtenstein, and to some extent - UK, Germany, Switzerland, and Baltic states. We envision as the natural way for our expansion through local JVs with financial institutions/entrepreneurs, willing to dive deep into the regulatory/licensing questions.*
3. *We  envision it will be always tied to the fiat value, as this should be convenient. However, it might be changed through the voting of token holders.*

**Q17.** **Cruncher's prophecy is still holding up. What are your thoughts about that? ðŸ˜‰**

*Intuition is normally based on knowledge and experience :)*

**Q18.** **Honest question here - if the normal person out there sees that it runs on the Stellar platform, why not just use lumens instead of Smartlands Token?**

*Thanks for the question, I think that is really important to explain.*

*The explanation however is simple - it's not about the underlying blockchain or settlement layer (it can be Stellar, Ethereum, Cosmos, or even Bitcoin - most probably all of these blockchains will be used in our global ecosystem on the distance 5-10 years) - it is about our technology and smart contracts for meeting all the compliance and regulatory requirement, KYC, limits, settlement, utility functions, etc.*

*All these processes will require some fees, and according to the Smartlands Whitepaper and token sale T&amp;C, we're bound to make the only possible way to pay fees on the platform in SLT token.*

**Q19.** **What is your teams shared drive that is making you all want to succeed?**

**Could you also please explain the best thing the team has done so far and one thing the team could have done slightly better?**

*Maybe it sounds too simple, but we really believe that we can change the current state of things, and the more we do, the more we see the support from our army of believers (our community), the easier it gets.*

*The best thing is that we all gathered in our effort, and everyone does his/her part properly. Itâ€™s both - the luck that itâ€™s us - Martin Birch, me, Inna, Natalia, Danylo, Viktor, and the rest of the office, and the experience and effort of everyone. The best we could do is to find each other several months earlier.*

**Q20.** **How soon do you expect to have your Ukranian license? Has there been any challenges in the process of obtaining it?**

*No major challenges, only a few delays due to COVID - in Ukraine currently there is the big 2nd wave.*

*The license should be ready in the coming weeks.*

**Q21.** **I am very excited for this AMA! ðŸ™ˆThanks for accepting the invite to host an AMA for Stellar community! ðŸ¾**

**I only have a simple question for you. Iâ€™ll leave the burning questions to others. What is your comfort food? â˜ºï¸**

*Many thanks for this event from me personally, and from all our team!*

*Last year I turned vegetarian (although not strict, just not eating/cooking meat at least at home and with family), and this was quite a big boost for productivity.*

*To mention some good example of what I eat, I'd prefer potato pancake with salted salmon and sour cream :)*

**Q22.** **What's your marketing strategy? Is it a big marketing campaign, or are you talking to specific businesses that look like they could be interested?**

*Thanks for the questions. Regarding the marketing campaign, as the first step we will open the platform for institutional investors, and this process is already full steam on face-to-face meetings.*

*Then we will open the venue for retail investors in Ukraine, and that's where the local marketing will kick in. Besides the wide campaign of digital marketing, we also rely here on the large customer support and acquisition team and call center.*

**Q23. Could you give us a breakdown of token distribution?**

*Thanks for the question!*

*7.1M total/max supply;*  
 *5.5M circulating.*

*Among the tokens not in circulation - 66% is the company treasury for long-term motivation (options) and partnerships, and 33% is the budget for direct investments.*

**Q24.** **Can you tell us why you are so passionate about smartlands, tokenization and the future of them both?**

*Thanks for the question!*

*The answer although is quite simple :) I really believe that this solution must exist, to allow all the people worldwide, no matter their net worth or income, to invest on the transparent platform, into profitable real economy assets that are just simply not available currently.*

*I personally find Smartlands and participated in the first token sale as an investor, for a reason - I found Smartlands and had an ""aha"" moment, knowing that such a platform will solve my personal problems and problems of all similar to me - IT professionals.*

**Q25.** **Do you have any news on the T1 exchange that SLT will be listed on?**

*Coming soon, exchange selected, and the process already ongoing.*

*Although please not expect before the platform and staking launch.*",ethereum,1

*â€œHonestly prediction markets may be one of the most underrated categories of Ethereum dapps right nowâ€* â€” [Vitalk Buterin](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1309078385369460741?lang=en)

Prediction   markets have existed in the Ethereum ecosystem since 2015 with the   launch of Augur a peer-to-peer order book based prediction market.   Despite being one of the earliest dapps on Ethereum, prediction markets   have made little progress compared to others like DEXs, NFTs, and DeFi   tools like lending and borrowing and leverage. Let us explore the   existing options and the problems they face. Later we will see how   PredictX aims to redefine prediction markets as a legitimate use case   for DeFi by ensuring better liquidity and aligning incentives for the   ecosystem.

**The Liquidity Problem:**

The major limitation to prediction markets is a lack of liquidity and lack of volume. [Augur](https://augur.net/)   through its decentralized order book-based model has very little   liquidity in its markets and the little liquidity in its ecosystem is   spread thing because of an oversaturation of event markets. Other peer   to pool (AMM based) protocols like [Gnosis](https://omen.eth.link/#/liquidity) and [Catnip](https://catnip.exchange/markets/0x5f623023ab1e7ff12b8fc02e4ee8cdcad67d0e80) also have very low liquidity which in turn result in little trade volume because of slippage.

When   there is low liquidity, for users to take a position on the outcome of   an event, it will cost them more money than the likelihood of the  event  happening.

*So   letâ€™s say an event market has 10 yes shares and 10 no shares. If   someone wanted to buy 1 yes share, then the price quoted for that yes   share would be around 0.5. However, if that someone wanted to buy 5 yes   shares, then the price quoted would be as high as 0.7 because there are   not many yes/no shares in the pool to begin with. This slippage would   not exist if were 1000 yes shares and 1000 no shares since that someone   buying 5 yes shares would get quoted a price around 0.5.*

So   liquidity is needed in order to make sure that the quoted price (i.e.   the price initially) is close enough to the execution price (the price   finally). This is a major problem in prediction markets and can only be   solved by having liquid markets.

**The User Experience Problem:**

On   top of the low liquidity and volume, these decentralized platforms  also  donâ€™t facilitate a good user experience from the interface to the   process of executing a transaction along with high gas fees on  Ethereum.

How to solve this? The solution is [here](https://medium.com/predictx-official/improving-the-fundamentals-of-prediction-markets-liquidity-and-user-experience-992a56479efe).",ethereum,1

t1_gti5k2t,"&gt; Isn't it a red flag if one wallet holds 22%? 

&gt; Or does this happen on a regular basis

Yes it would/could be a concern depending on who the wallet holder was, (although it's very common, especially for newer projects), but I'm fairly certain the wallet you're talking about is Pancakeswap. 

They need to hold those tokens in order to balance the coins to keep the supply constant across the Ethereum and Binance chain. 

If it's not the Pancakeswap wallet you're talking about it's most likely the team wallet. However, you're best to ask in the official Telegram or Discord for the ***Open Governance Project*** if you're concerned about this wallet.",ethereum,1

t1_gtg09fg,"&gt;If Ethereum fails to stay above the $2,000 support and the 100 hourly SMA, there is a risk of a downside break. The first major support is near the $1,980 level.

&gt;Any more losses might lead ether price towards the $1,900 support zone. If the bulls fail to protect $1,900, there could be a test of the $1,850 support zone in the near term.

t1_gtgn17s,"&gt;If they resort to trying to destroy it completely it's because they can't spy on users and gave up trying.

I'm operating under this specific assumption (that they've given up), but you are 100% correct about the application of 0day exploits. It's far more beneficial for them to be able to spy on users without their knowledge.

The problem for them (the government) in that case is prioritizing targets. Once someone is busted doing something illegal with Monero, everyone will know the system is compromised and that they can be targeted as well. It's a catch-22 from the government perspective; they want to compromise Monero to target criminals, but once they've revealed they have this ability it pretty much ensures nobody (smart) will continue to use it for illegal purposes.

t1_gth3szv,"&gt;It's fun to share with your friends

You can already share gifs and HD video clips for free. You don't need to spend $60k to do it.

&gt;It's basically card collecting in a nutshell, it's really fun opening a pack that's like 9 bucks and seeing your favourite player dunking or making some crazy play.

Again, you don't need to pay for any of this. You're not actually getting a pack of cards.

At least when speculative bubbles in collectors cards collapse you at least have the cards to play with. With NBA gifs you have a gif you could have gotten for free anyway, could have gotten a HD video clip of for free.

&gt;Given this, there are very rare cards. I'm talking about stuff like 1 in 10 Lebron cards that like a million people want that came out right when the application started. Well, with scarcity it drives prices up. There are millionaires and NBA players that would pay for a lot for these with little care for money, and that's why you have $60,000 NFTs.

I don't know how this contradicts ""the only use case is buying them so you can perhaps sell them to other speculators at a later date, or perhaps lose 70% in a month""

Of course, my original comment was sarcastic because that's also the case for bitcoin, but at least bitcoin has enough techno-jargon and supposed use cases to fool speculators longer than a month.

&gt;Frankly I couldn't care about the price, since I just really like the platform. But granted that I've already realized more than 1000% gains from Topshots.

If you don't care about the price why do you know what the price gains have been?",bitcoin,1
t1_gth9fgw,"&gt;So you do care about the price then.

I wouldn't care if it was worth 0 or a couple bucks that I bought it for. If it becomes reasonably priced up, I'd obviously sell it. 

&gt;If you agree its worthless without the ability to profit off it you're agreeing there's no value in it but speculation. It's just yet another empty speculative vehicle.

I just told you the functionality aspect, that's zoomed past your head. I've had more fun opening packs for a few dollars with my friends, that alone was already worth the base price. 

&gt;Are you telling me you bought Bitcoin for reasons other than the speculate on it?

Oh buddy, you've opened a whole new can of worms. I've bought Bitcoin in 2011 when I was in high school because I wanted to buy video games and didn't want my parents to find out.

I don't even know what Bitcoin is at this point and don't understand his rambling. Fast forward a few months, our group of four friends spend our time discussing coins and the market every time we hang out. I keep it hidden from my family, rarely talk about it outside my group of friends.

In April 2017, I decided to mention it to my parents. My parents never invested in their live and their action was predictable: they started calling me stupid, to take out my money and the profit before I lost everything, that it's a scam, etc. Months go on, I show my increasing profits to my parents out of spite every time I see them (once a week). A few weeks later, my mom cracks and quietly asks me if I could invest a small amount for her. She starts reading up on markets and coins. A few weeks again, she bought her own ledger, continues investing. Around December, she started getting nervous, having sleepless nights looking at her portfolio. She decides to sell, not far from the top at 21k, timing the market better then me or any of my friends (we hodled since then).

With the profits she bought herself a new car and a fur coat. She has been kicking herself that she didn't buy back in and sees no point to buy in ever since it went past 10k. I tried convincing her to invest again, but my step father wants to invest a big amount, and she isn't comfortable with the stress that it brings since she would have to take care of it, so she doesn't invest at all.

t3_mkn4zx,"After cruising the posts here, and following various telegram groups, I have come to the conclusion that many people in DeFi are trading blind, and it's crazy. **If you are trading anything in DeFi, YOU NEED TO BE USING A CHARTING TOOL.**

I have done a deepdive into the following platforms, and I will tell you briefly about them, and why I believe [Chartex.pro](https://Chartex.pro) and it's native token $CHART is the most undervalued of the space:

**What tokens/platforms exist?**

[Chartex.pro](https://Chartex.pro) Market Cap $9.1M        Holders: 5125

[Dextools.io](https://Dextools.io)  Market Cap $71.9M      Holders: 4826

[Astrotools.io](https://Astrotools.io)  Market Cap $4.6M     Holders: 1572

[Moontools.io](https://Moontools.io)  Market Cap $4.9M     Holders: 728

[UniDexbeta.app](https://UniDexbeta.app) Market Cap $4.3M Holders: 833

[cryptokek.com](https://cryptokek.com)  Market Cap $5M     Holders:  614

[apetools.gg](https://apetools.gg) Market Cap $1.7M        Holders: 2215

[bogged.finance](https://bogged.finance) Market Cap 19.8M  Holders: 8526

Damn, 8 different ones...! OK, this space is starting to get crowded, the market will have to pick some winners soon. The stakes are quite high. These sorts of tools are getting more and more valuable every day. Total market cap of crypto is now over 2 trillion dollars.

After the last bull-run, [Coinmarketcap.com](https://Coinmarketcap.com) itself was [acquired by Binance for over $400M](https://decrypt.co/24031/binance-to-acquire-coinmarketcap-in-400-million-deal). That was when total Crypto assets were valued at 1/25th of what they are now.

So, one of these guys is going to be a billion dollar company. There will be consolidation and one will become the **Bloomberg of Defi and Crypto**

**Businesses already making money**

As it stands, **Dextools** was first with the largest adoption. However they have yet to add BSC charts, however they have a powerful platform and pay dividends to holders of over 100k $DEXT. Right now, those dividends are averaging about $2000 a month in passive income for holders. Dext has the best wallet identification and tracking of the bunch.

**UniDex** is also paying dividends, and it is not just to the top holders, it is to ALL holders, and the profit sharing is paid in BNB. The lead dev and project manager stands behind his work, and has often been called ""the hardest working guy in DeFi"". Krunal Amin is active and pushes development 7 days a week. The first payout for holder was last month.

**Bogged finance and Apetools specialize in (and exist on) BSC right now**. Bogged has amazingly ramped up operations allowing for limit orders and all kinds of special features. Apetools is lagging and the Marketcap shows. Both tokens have burns on all token transactions. Which is attractive for degen plays, but complicates things for serious investors. (APE's $NANA has a 1% tax and Bogged's $BOG has a 4.5% tax)

**Astrotools** and **Moontools** have long been the uniswap tracking underdogs, but both have recently added BSC support and Moontools even has support for xDai's Honeyswap. Both have lagged in marketcap but now are catching up.

As for [**Chartex.pro**](https://Chartex.pro), these guys are the leaders in design, and were first movers on BSC support using their Metamorphosis Platform. It is a case of you get what you pay for. Chartex has by far the fastest tracking of movements, tracks all tokens, and allows you to see individual wallet movements both on Ethereum and BSC. To get full access to Chartex, you need to hold 5000 $CHART tokens, but for serious traders, it's worth it. Chartex is soon releasing a monthly fee based system, and loads of new features: [https://chartex.pro/?symbol=UNISWAP%3ACHART.95E63E&amp;interval=60&amp;theme=Dark#/tiers](https://chartex.pro/?symbol=UNISWAP%3ACHART.95E63E&amp;interval=60&amp;theme=Dark#/tiers)

**Where is this headed?**

I believe that we will see a few of these reach 1 billion dollar MCs at people make bets on where financial information will be coming from in the future. My general take is that all people speculating on DeFi should be holding at least a few of these project tokens.

**Based on current number of holders/users of each token compared to current marketcap, where do I think you should put your money?**

1. [Chartex.pro](https://Chartex.pro) 10-20 x near-term at the next coming breakout and as v2/metamorphosis news comes
2. [Dextools.io](https://Dexttools.io) 5 x possibilities as investors digest the reality of the large platform dividends
3. [Unidexbeta.app](https://Unidexbeta.app) 10-20x near-term as word about profit sharing spreads
4. A Basket of the others. I would say bogged, but the current MC seems high for where we are (but not for where we are going). High risk/high reward is [apetools.gg](https://apetools.gg), market cap is tiny and simple attempts to catch it's peers could result in quick 10x pushes.

My research goes much deeper than this, but I will leave it here for an initial post. I will add more later to try and help you track who the leaders are in in this space.

TLDR:

Buy $CHART, use it's platform and sleep soundly. Buy a full basket of Tokens the the space if you want to build generational wealth. It's not going away.

central bank money printing will lead to inflation or the decrease in the value of money over time. Bitcoin, by contrast, has a fixed limit of 21 million coins that can ever be created. This limited supply allows bitcoin to resist inflation. Simple facts.

t3_mklkeo,"Are you tired of signing on to Reddit and checking out SSB, only to be inundated with meme tokens and coins getting all the hype with little to no fundamentals or use cases? The meme coins that have already been pumped and dumped are being blindly shilled so you can catch a falling knife.

This doesnâ€™t have to be the case. What if this week's moonshot was a token with an established customer base, a steadily growing market cap, and already in use? Iâ€™m here to push forward STPT, the Standard Tokenization Protocol token, as this weekâ€™s buy. 

Many of you have been burned the last couple of weeks by buying some of the tokens winning or placing high in these polls. STPT has also made the top 10 two weeks in a row and guess what? We are riding a steady wave upwards, supported by strong, useful, and already-adopted use cases. 

STPT market cap: US$121,536,962\* (29.35% increase from this time last week!)

24h volume: US$41,174,933\*

Current price: US$0.10450 (18.60% increase from this time last week!)\*\*

STPTâ€™s market cap and price are steadily increasing towards the breakout point. TA indicates that once an hourly candle closes above $0.133 itâ€™s GAME OVER and your chance to get in before it goes parabolic is gone.

Now, about those use cases. STP has been rolling out exciting, new developments both inside the STP ecosystem and beyond, and they show no sign of slowing down. For example, in order to reach a larger audience and broaden its vertical markets, STP has entered into some promising partnerships:

* To expand into the fast-growing NFT sector, STP recently acquired part of Piction Network. Piction is a peer-to-peer digital assets platform directly connecting creators and users to eliminate the need for expensive intermediaries (middlemen sucking up value without adding any). STP will help with NFT integration into the Piction Network platform which will introduce a whole new market for its users and community. With Piction Network, STP is looking to pave the way for new business.
* By investing in Cobak, STP has entered into a strategic partnership with the popular cryptocurrency platform. With over 300,000 users, Cobak is the one of the largest blockchain communities in Korea. With this collaboration, STP network expands their presence on the Asian markets. In addition, STP network and Cobak, together with other industry-leading projects, have joined forces to form the Korean Polkadot Alliance (KPA) with the objective to facilitate and accelerate the development of the Polkadot ecosystem in Korea.
* STP also entered into a partnership with [Travala.com](https://Travala.com) allowing consumers to finance their holiday with STPT. [Travala.com](https://Travala.com), which recently joined forces with [Expedia.com](https://Expedia.com) and [Booking.com](https://Booking.com), is a leading blockchain-based travel agency. This partnership will allow exposure of STPT to a rapidly growing user base and add an exciting real-life use to STPT.
* The successful integration of its stablecoin, USTP, with the Curve Finance platform, a decentralized exchange running on Ethereum designed to easily swap different stablecoins with low fees and minimal slippage, provides a USTP/USDT liquidity pool. In the future STP network is planning more integrations with leading DeFi platforms to expand their presence in Decentralized Finance.

As you can see, STPT sets itself apart from the rest of the crowd. This promising project with low market cap, real-world applications, and recent, organic growth should be an obvious choice!

GET protocol is blockchain ticketing company that has already sold 600k tickets and ticketing companies in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Sout korea use it

Here's my take on why GET protocol's smart and blockchain registered tickets becoming NFT's will revolutionize the ticketing industry.

So whatâ€™s a NFT exactly? NFT stands for non fungible token. This is a token thatâ€™s unique on the blockchain and not mutually interchangeable. This in contrast to for example Bitcoin where it doesnâ€™t matter which Bitcoin you have (1 BTC = 1 BTC). Every ticket issued by the GET protocol will become a getNFT.

Eventhough GETâ€™s NFTâ€™s will be the most used, bought &amp; traded NFTâ€™s in the crypto space the goal isnâ€™t to ride the hype. Ticketing + NFT = a match made in heaven. And hereâ€™s why:

As every ticket on the blockchain will become a NFT and thus unqiue, it will allow non custodial ownership of the ticket asset. This gives many interesting advantages but 2 stand out for me personally: P2P ticket trading &amp; DeFi event financing.

**Benifits of NFT tickets on GET Protocol**

* **Merging of the primary and secondary market avoiding scalping**
* **Defi event financing**
* **Attaching extra premium features to tickets for increased fan engagement, an NFT for attending an event, free poster, single or album with the ticket**

This will be the first and only nft ticketing system that will allow ticket trading while at the same time making scalping impossible. Regulators have been struggling for a long time to solve this problem and what seemed impossible to achieve will be made possible by smart contracts! The impact of this will be huge and will change the ticketing space for the better.  
Additionally and not unimportantly it will give the event organizer an extra revenue stream. The money that right now for a large part goes to scalpers (the secondary ticket market is worth $15B) will be tapped into by the event organizers.

**Event financing**  
Without a doubt one of the most promising and exciting things to look forward to in 2021 is the introduction of decentralized event financing to GET Protocol.  
Event organizers often struggle to get financing for their events. This doesnâ€™t only apply to starting artists, but even to famous stars. The artists need to have a lot of capital in advance as they have to pay for the venues, organisation, upfront while only receiving the money after the show is over. Enter GETâ€™s DeFi solution!

&gt;*The pre-financing of events for event-organizers is not a solution looking for a problem; itâ€™s a widely known and used tool that enables event organizers to make the investments needed to get their shows or festivals off the ground.*  
*In the past we have encountered Event Organizers who select their ticketing partner solely based on the amount of money and loan conditions that they are offered up front.*

Thanks to getNFT tickets youâ€™ll be able to pre-finance events of your choice. You can choose to finance new artists (more risk/more APY) or established kpop stars (less risk/less APY).

This is how it will work:

[https://preview.redd.it/d9uxit01xje61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=093877afe2f5b1931c7d2bc4511c946285b2f27d](https://preview.redd.it/d9uxit01xje61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=093877afe2f5b1931c7d2bc4511c946285b2f27d)

*If the concept seems complicated, hereâ€™s what you need to understand about GETâ€™s decentralized financing solution:*  
*1.) Event organizers will be able to easily pre-finance their events. (Something they desperately crave.)*  
*2.) Investors will be able to invest in events of their choice, at a risk &amp; reward level that they feel comfortable with.*  
*3.) The $GET token is an integral part of the financing process, as it is required for â€˜skin in the gameâ€™ from*

The advantage event financing for GET token holders will bring is again twofold:

1. As a GET holder youâ€™ll be able to finance events and share in the profit of the ticket sales. This means that GET will allow you to profit without selling = passive income. An important note is that this is profit without inflation. While other DeFi projects give you returns by increasing the supply (and thus decreasing the value of the token) the returns here will not increase the GET supply, as the returns come from real profit(ticket sales).
2. As the GET token will be an integral part of this process, it will:  
\- increase the buy pressure of the GET token (everyone who wants to participate will need GET)  
\- decrease the supply (everyone who participates will have to locks his GET tokens).

You have probably seen links to the [Poocoin App](https://poocoin.app/) come up in various pitches on this and other subs. In addition to having a continuously improving web app to view prices and track your wallet for BSC (Binance Smart Chain), there is a coin associated with the project ([Poocoin](https://poocoin.app/poocoin)) that I am extremely bullish on.

What problem is Poocoin solving?

Poocoin helps folks track BSC (Binance Smart Chain) wallets and understand how individual coins are trading. Given how high-risk and volatile crypto markets are, this is an incredibly important function â€“ and it hasnâ€™t surprised me to see links to poocoin charts popping up all over the place.

**A bit of background:** Right now there are two primary DEX (decentralized exchanges), and most of the coins youâ€™ll see here are traded on one of them. [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/) is used for trading coins against Ethereum (ETH), while [PancakeSwap](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/) is used for trading coins against Binance Coin (BNB) â€“ projects on the latter are also referred to as Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

[Uni](https://info.uniswap.org/home) and [Pancake](https://pancakeswap.info/pairs) both have native analytics interfaces, but they are very limited in functionality, and Pancakeâ€™s significantly lags real-time trades. Additionally, they do not do a good job of showing price movement or individual transactions. For digging into individual transactions and wallets, [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) and [BSCScan](https://bscscan.com/) are great for research if you know what youâ€™re doing â€“ but itâ€™s hard to understand trends and see the bigger picture from there.

[Dextools](https://www.dextools.io/app/) has rightly emerged as the leading analytics / charting app for Uniswap, with great charts and individual transaction data. BSC / Pancake have been lacking a similarly high-functioning, fast, reliable solution. Poocoin provides that solution â€“ with charts, transaction tracking, wallet tracking, [Yield Farm tracking (Toilet feature)](https://poocoin.app/toilet) and more to come as driven by the community. I donâ€™t think the app is quite at the level of Dextools just yet in terms of features, but itâ€™s not far off and quickly improving as the community requests new features. Check out the [telegram](https://t.me/poocointokenchat) to see how it really is a community-driven project, with users requesting features and the lead developer responding in real-time.

The web app is cool but what does the token have to do with it and why should I buy it?

Unlike many projects which trade on the promise of future functionality (no shade, Iâ€™ve invested in many of these) â€“ poocoin began as a product first, with the token added in what seemed like an afterthought. The point was to create something useful for traders. More recently, the token has begun to play a bigger role in the ecosystem, including a new [premium tier](https://poocoin.app/premium) to track other wallets if you are pooling BNB / POO in the Pancake pool. I donâ€™t speak for the Poocoin creator, but I have spoken with them and I think that over time the coin itself will play a more important role in the ecosystem, for instance unlocking certain premium tracking / alerting features while retaining most of the functionality for all users / free.

On that topic, one thing that I love about this project is that the focus has been much more on building the community of users than extracting value by requiring people to hold or pay POO, so I think that most new features will continue to be available to all users. Itâ€™s also been almost completely organic growth to date, with people using the product and getting acquainted with the coin because of that â€“ as usage and the community grows, I believe the price of the coin will as well.

Tell me more about the tokenomics and how much upside potential this thing has?

**â€” Redistribution / deflationary mechanism.** 8% fee charged for each transaction, 4% distributed to token holders (in accordance to the size of their POO holdings), 4% burned. Seems like a lot of coins here recently have a deflationary / redistribution mechanism and I think for good reason. Transaction fee + redistribution incentivizes hodlers over swing traders, and youâ€™re able to increase your holdings simply by having the coin in your wallet (apart from price appreciation). And then the token burn deflates supply which creates upward pressure on the price over time. Additionally, no more than 100,000 can be traded in 1 transaction, meaning thereâ€™s a limit on huge whale buys / sells.

**â€” Itâ€™s still very early**. The initial supply was 10M POO. The total supply now (5pm Pacific on 3/13/21) is 6,839,793 with a price of around $0.30. Thatâ€™s a market cap of $2.05 M. Compare that to GoSwapp (BSC charting platform that people appear to be using significantly less than poocoin, at least the last few weeks) @ $36M (18x for Poocoin), Unidex (another BSC charting tool that poocoin has surpassed in functionality imo) @ $19M (9.5x for Poocoin), or DexTools at $151M (75x for Poocoin). **Comparables are always tough in crypto but Iâ€™m planning on hodling until at least $6 (20x current value)**.

**â€“ No presale and distribution of holders has grown less concentrated over time.** As described in this excellent [moonshots 101](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/mbdlil/cryptomoonshots_101/), a presale is often (not always imo) an indicator that there are a lot of large holders looking to make a quick buck who will sell off at the first sign of a peak. Poocoin had no presale; it simply launched on PancakeSwap. If youâ€™re buying in now, there are folks like me who bought in at a lower price (I got in around $0.10 and have been buying more gradually, including significantly more at the current price today). I canâ€™t speak for other holders, and of course there will be those who take some profits as price continues to rise. But I do get the sense from the community that a lot of people see the rare potential here and are looking to ride out the waves until it hits a large multiple of its current price before they consider selling.

**â€“ What about liquidity and volatility?** Liquidity was a significant concern for myself and many in the community for the past week or two. Currently, liquidity in Pancake sits at \~$120k (i.e. \~$60k worth of BNB and \~$60k worth of POO). More liquidity generally means less volatility (i.e. a given buy / sell has less price impact), and itâ€™s a generally a good thing for a coinâ€™s legitimacy. Realizing the liquidity issue, Poocoin added a [premium tier](https://poocoin.app/premium) accessible via being a liquidity provider. As a result, there has been a sizable increase in liquidity over the past few days (currently \~$120k in the pool) although I'd like to see it go significantly higher still â€“ given the responsiveness of the team to this issue, Iâ€™m confident liquidity will continue to increase.

**â€“ Sounds good but whatâ€™s with the name? Are you really comparing a coin called Poocoin to DexTools?** When I bought in, I found the name amusing, but growth-wise I saw it as maybe a good thing (meme potential / funny) or maybe a bad thing (may prevent people from taking the project seriously). I could still go either way â€“ although I do like that it's a funny reference to the storm of shitcoins we are all in with some on-the-nose irony that this actually is **not** a no-utility shitcoin. Name aside, check out the community and use the product â€“ I'm confident this is the real deal.

**â€“ Okay but what if DexTools adds BSC or Unidex or Goswapp improve their features and surpass Poocoin?** If DexTools added BSC features tomorrow (they have not made any such announcements to my knowledge and if it happens, seems like it will be awhile), I think that would pose a modest risk for the Poocoin productâ€™s continual user growth. However, Poocoin really has added many features that rival DexTools, while adding unique features like the best Wallet Tracking Iâ€™ve experienced across any of these types of apps. DexTools and others also appear more keen to gate premium features with high subscription costs ([$75+ month](https://www.dextools.io/) for wallet tracking).

On Unidex / Goswapp, I think they will continue to improve their products (coin tracking / analytics is a huge space and there could be many successful projects), but Iâ€™ve been incredibly impressed with the pace of Pooâ€™s development and adoption relative to them â€“ and personally I think it's a much better product than those. **And again, those are currently 9.5 and 18x Pooâ€™s market cap!**

Aight, how do I buy this thing and join the community?

More liquidity generally means less volatility (i.e. a given buy / sell has less price impact), and itâ€™s a generally a good thing for a coinâ€™s legitimacy. Realizing the liquidity issue, Poocoin added a [premium tier](https://poocoin.app/premium) accessible via being a liquidity provider. As a result, there has been a sizable increase in liquidity over the past few days (currently \~$120k in the pool) although I'd like to see it go significantly higher still â€“ given the responsiveness of the team to this issue, Iâ€™m confident liquidity will continue to increase.

**â€“ Sounds good but whatâ€™s with the name? Are you really comparing a coin called Poocoin to DexTools?** When I bought in, I found the name amusing, but growth-wise I saw it as maybe a good thing (meme potential / funny) or maybe a bad thing (may prevent people from taking the project seriously). I could still go either way â€“ although I do like that it's a funny reference to the storm of shitcoins we are all in with some on-the-nose irony that this actually is **not** a no-utility shitcoin. Name aside, check out the community and use the product â€“ I'm confident this is the real deal.

**â€“ Okay but what if DexTools adds BSC or Unidex or Goswapp improve their features and surpass Poocoin?** If DexTools added BSC features tomorrow (they have not made any such announcements to my knowledge and if it happens, seems like it will be awhile), I think that would pose a modest risk for the Poocoin productâ€™s continual user growth. However, Poocoin really has added many features that rival DexTools, while adding unique features like the best Wallet Tracking Iâ€™ve experienced across any of these types of apps. DexTools and others also appear more keen to gate premium features with high subscription costs ([$75+ month](https://www.dextools.io/) for wallet tracking).

On Unidex / Goswapp, I think they will continue to improve their products (coin tracking / analytics is a huge space and there could be many successful projects), but Iâ€™ve been incredibly impressed with the pace of Pooâ€™s development and adoption relative to them â€“ and personally I think it's a much better product than those. **And again, those are currently 9.5 and 18x Pooâ€™s market cap!**

Aight, how do I buy this thing and join the community?

t3_mkmbxs,"After you guys reacted so overwhelmingly positive to my previous post, where I shared a bot that buys Bitcoin when Elon Musk Tweets about it, I decided to share the last project that I'm working on at the moment.

It's a script that searches the web for cryptocurrency news, taking keywords as input and then passes those to a text sentiment API, analysing how many of the headlines are positive, neutral or negative. 

I'm thinking about integrating this with an Exchange and testing the strategy out for a couple of weeks and then share my results. 

Just like with the Elon bot, my logic is that if you catch the wave just as the news breaks, you can jump in early before everyone else does, well apart from everyone who already trades like this hahah.

t1_gtgdlyu,"Bitcoin aside for a second (as michael saylor has talked enough about how he thinks it solves the gold portability problem, by upgrading an analog rock into a digital asset) the price of digital assets of programmable blockchains (ie blockchains that can or will be able to compute smart contracts, such as ethereum, binance smart chain, cardano, solana, algo, tezos, eos, avalanche, fantom, harmony, others) make it such that these platforms are inherently competitive in nature. The holders of each platform's tokens want it to succeed, so there is a strong innate incentive to increase transactions per second, confidence in the platform itself, governance functionality, complexity of the transactions that can take place, etc.

Google any big-4 accounting firm's report on the prospects of smart contracts towards completing a range of complex transactions, eg (1) securitization of ABS, (2) secondary markets issuance and trading, (3) insurance involving countries with weak or unreliable legal systems to reliably effectuate insurance contracts, (4) identity record keeping and de-identification as they relate to crowd-funding and other transactions where some amount of each party's identity, whether commercial or personal, needs verification, (5) NFT's being tied to all kinds of different property title to aid in the transfer of said titles, either as part of a smart-contract will or complex transaction. The value of blockchain itself in the future will almost certainly outperform the value of bitcoin (its utility value as well as monetary value, unless you say that bitcoin is valuable because it led to programmable blockchains), as the value of blockchain will likely rise all the oceans on which our digital lives take place, thus rising all boats.

Any reputable programable blockchain today is a  ""shared computer,"" (or what Coindesk calls a ""global computer"" in its top-20 analysis) which allows for (1) verifiability (for those who can or need to verify), (2) immutability (cannot make edits to the record without a majority (or for some chains 33% plus of the network's power), and without those edits being recorded), (3) efficiency (arguably low right now tbh but set to increase based on the competitive environment of programmable blockchains fueled by each platforms digital asset price), and (4) transparency (similar to verifiability, but in that you can see things in real time and it's possible to develop software on top of these blockchains that conveniently communicate what's going on, (5) redundancy, where a blockchain is replicated in a decentralized or distributed way so that it's practically impossible to erase  the chain of events, and (6) governance, where agents of the blockchain are economically incentivized to alter the performance of the blockchain as needed in response to changing circumstances, to prevent obsolescence.. eg quantum computing is invented and upgrades are needed to increase encryption. In terms of bitcoin, it's possible to increase the 21 million limit higher for all I know.. so yeah, this sixth point is where things might get messy for platforms that don't have as much restrictions on governance, or where governance is decided by people who have a small minority of the economic value of digital assets on the platform, ie made by a centralized agent with a negligible economic interest in the platform.

I think the fifth factor (5) redundancy, as I imagine ten-twenty years down the road, you'll have a competing web of public programmable blockchains interopping with one another (ie no Binance smart chain unless Binance offers insurance on all transactions completed on their chain, or there's accessible and effective third-party insurance), and if one chain goes down, things will slide onto a secondary chain that will replace the primary chain until its fixed. It's hard for me to see a world where only one platform, eg ethereum, has total control of the programmable blockchain market.",ethereum,1

t3_mkq91h,"Crypto storage projects have got some attention lately and since I have been following this field since 2017 very closely I thought that I could share my views on different projects and maybe someone finds my information valuable. Anyways do your own research and these arenâ€™t investment advices but my own views.

Biggest name in the crypto storage field is obviously Filecoin but thereâ€™s more out there. Other projects that Iâ€™m going through are Siacoin, Storj and Opacity Storage.

**Filecoin (#14 in coinmarketcap)**

Filecoin is currently holding the biggest market cap in the data storage field. They got $275M in VC funding in 2017 and have used that funding to develop their platform and to attract new investments to the project.

Filecoin has a market cap of $11,363,290,721 but thatâ€™s not all. Since Filecoin has only a very small portion of their tokens in circulation what we want to look at is their fully diluted market cap which is currently at $352,964,822,346. That means that their fully diluted market cap is already about 50% bigger than Ethereumâ€™s.

So what makes Filecoin 50% more valuable than Ethereum? I havenâ€™t found a reason for that. They already have a working network with some proof of concept products but I have understood that thereâ€™s not real traction on those products yet. I can easily understand why itâ€™s so difficult to get users for products built using Filecoin since Filecoin has itâ€™s limitations inherited from IPFS. 

Currently the most promising product built on top of Filecoin is Slate[ https://slate.host/](https://slate.host/). I have tried that product but itâ€™s not realistic that I would use it as my daily data storage. 

Limitations include 4 GB total limit for data storage and if you want to host more you canâ€™t buy an account upgrade but instead you can pay one file at a time for pinning those files in the network. Problem is that you have to go through the payment process separately for every file that you want to upload and thereâ€™s also a limitation that these files have to be at least 100 MB in size. I understand that these limitations come from IPFS but I donâ€™t see that itâ€™s possible to get many users for products like this as thereâ€™s so many limitations that make it unusable for most of the users.

**Siacoin (#65 in coinmarketcap)**

Sia is already a big name in crypto storage and decentralized internet and they have a strong fan community. Siaâ€™s market cap is currently $1,765,070,707 and their fully diluted market cap is the same as circulating supply.

Despite Sia being a familiar name in crypto storage and decentralized internet they are also at the point where they still donâ€™t really have products with users. Their data storage solution requires you to run part of their network at your own computer to store your files to their platform. Thereâ€™s also some â€proof of conceptâ€ -stage products built on top of Sia where you can pin your files to network without running Sia networkâ€™s node at your own computer but these lack usability and redundancy so far so same as with Filecoin itâ€™s very difficult to get users for these products.

Thereâ€™s also quite many concerns raised about Siacoin and hereâ€™s shot summary written by their former team member (full version available here:[ https://siasetup.info/concerns-about-sia-and-skynet](https://siasetup.info/concerns-about-sia-and-skynet))

* **Sia:** The product has many technical issues which make it unstable and unusable, issues which have persisted for years
* **Skynet:** It's a poorly thought out extension of Sia which will never compete with the traditional Internet, and is more similar to GeoCities than Web3
* **SC/SF:** Sia's original self-funding methods have failed, and no Siafund holders seem to want to admit it
* **Sia Team:** They have no direction and still act like a startup full of pretentious college kids which think they know better than everyone else
* **Sia Foundation:** A new money-printing entity funded by a large block reward, which may not really be separate from Nebulous or work in the community's interests
* **Sia Community:** They idolize the team, can't tolerate criticism, will push objectors out, and will go down with the ship
* **Conclusion:** Sia and Skynet aren't going to work out on their current trajectory, and people have been banned for articulating why

**Opacity Storage (#644 in coinmarketcap)**

Opacity Storage isnâ€™t yet a very known project but they have taken different approach than projects mentioned earlier. They have started their project by thinking about what users want from data storage product and what makes those usable. Then they have made working product and improving technology on-the-go. Opacityâ€™s current fully diluted market cap is $62,216,653. Thereâ€™s only 130 million OPCT tokens available and thereâ€™s no more tokens coming.

Opacity offers a working product which has imitated many usability aspects from traditional data storage options such as Dropbox and Google Cloud. Exception is that in Opacity all files are splitted into chunks and encrypted client-side so whoever is hosting the files has no way to know what they are hosting. Opacity has also built their platform focusing very much on userâ€™s privacy on other aspects also. Thereâ€™s no link to the user account from files so even if some file is shared publicly nobody(even the Opacity team) canâ€™t know which storage account it belongs to. Opacity Storage isnâ€™t collecting any personal information at any phase of sign-in or other processes. Opacity Storage offers a 10 GB free account which you can upgrade to 128 GB, 1 TB or 2 TB plan by paying with OPCT token. They also offer Enterprise plans if someone needs bigger storage. There's an easy to use web interface and also some community developed desktop apps. They also have a mobile app with file syncing on their roadmap and it should be released during this summer.

Opacity Storage however has currently all files hosted in AWS but since their data splitting and encryption is so strong thereâ€™s no way that data could be accessed by AWS employees or any hacker entering AWS systems. Opacity is releasing whitepaper 2.0 in the coming weeks where they will tell more about their plans for decentralization but this is what is know already:

* Becoming storage node you have to stake OPCT token as a collateral that ensures that you have incentive to keep your storage node up for the time that you have promised to host files
* Storage nodes are paid in OPCT for hosting the files. There will be different levels of payment per GB depending on factors as bandwidth speed, uptime, etc.
* It will be possible to host storage node at your personal computer or with some easy to use script you can start your own storage node in AWS also so you donâ€™t have to have your computer at home on all the time

Their working product is already available at[ opacity.io](http://opacity.io/) and they started open beta testing of their new web app called Opacity 2.0. Open beta is available at[ dev2.opacity.io](http://dev2.opacity.io/)

Personally I think that Opacity Storage has the brightest future in crypto data storage field since they have taken user friendly approach with their product and their current fully diluted market cap is still very low compared to Filecoin (5 763 times bigger than OPCT) and Siacoin (29 times bigger than OPCT).

What are your thoughts on crypto data storage? Are you still betting on Filecoin or Siacoinâ€™s success or are you like me and see that Opacity will eventually take their place as #1 crypto data storage project?",ethereum,1

First the token will be released in Binance Smart Chain, so load your BNB ready. You can swap GULAG in PancakeSwap after launch.
Second wave will be taking over Ethereum Chain. After second phase is done, you can swap GULAG in Uniswap.
Dev planned the launch today, time and contract details will be announced. Stay tuned in the Telegram Chat.

My personal view: Yes, this project is new, and still a lot of unknowns. But I have the impression this dev is very serious, and when community grows this token is a good one to keep. The 1 day restricted selling is unique in Bsc-world and every wallet holder joins the daily lottery automatically. When people like this, they will stay at the project. Also no presale is a sign that the project is here to stay. But again, there are a lot of unknowns and the true motives of the project devs are also unknown. What's also unknown is how the community will grow and what the market will do. Those are the risks, but that's the price you pay; for being one of the very first and in regards of the unknowns described earlier. But off course DYOR.

# Overview

Chow Chow Finance (CHOW) is a low cap RFI fork meme coin that first launched as an erc20 token in early February. Like many other redistribution tokens, all transactions are charged a fee (3% in this case), which is redistributed to all holders in proportion to their holdings. Early on, the community put together a wallet of 1 million CHOW tokens (they donated them out of their own pockets). This wallet is now known as the charity wallet; those 1 million tokens (1% of the total supply) are never touched, but the interest they generate via transaction fees is periodically donated to charity. The first donation ($2,232.48 USD) was made to Operation Kindess ([https://twitter.com/OpKindness](https://twitter.com/OpKindness)) in mid-March. CHOW is currently in the middle of the second charity drive, which will be ending towards the end of April, and for which it is partnered with Morris Animal Refuge ([https://twitter.com/MorrisAnimal](https://twitter.com/MorrisAnimal)).

CHOW is a community-driven project. The community is wholesome. The team is made up of volunteers from the community who bought their CHOW on the market like everybody else. In short, CHOW is a meme coin with a heart. A wholesomecoin.

# Tokenomics

First of all, it's important to note that, as of 8 days ago, a second CHOW token was launched under the same contract, but as a bep20 token on BSC, as a way to expose CHOW to a new market space and give people a way to gain exposure to the project without paying exorbitant gas fees. These tokens are not bridged, and so they are independent. However, as, they have the same contract, they have the same tokenomics. I'll write more on this below, as it can be confusing.

CHOW has a circulating supply of 100 million. It is neither inflationary nor deflationary: tokens are neither minted nor burned. 

As mentioned above, every buy, sell, or transfer is charged a 3% fee, which is redistributed to all wallet addresses that hold CHOW, in proportion to their holdings. It is important to note that exchanges are excluded from this, so CHOW isn't being redistributed to exchange addresses and liquidity pools, only real holders.

**Both tokens have 100% liquidity lock**: 

ERC20 liq lock: [https://team.finance/view-coin/0x925f2C11b99c1A4c46606898ee91eD3D450cFedA](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x925f2C11b99c1A4c46606898ee91eD3D450cFedA)

At the time of writing, the erc20 token has a market cap of 1.16 million, with 943 holders, and the new bep20 token has a market cap of 374 thousand, with 426 holders, with the average wallet therefore holding $1,120 worth of CHOW.

**Both tokens have been audited by Solidity:** [https://solidity.finance/audits/CHOW/](https://solidity.finance/audits/CHOW/)

# Charity

Both tokens have their own charity wallet holding 1 million tokens, which accrue interest from transactions fees. At the end of each charity drive period, the tokens accrued by these wallets are sold back to the market, and the proceeds are donated to the charity that the community selected for that drive. At that point, a partner for the next charity drive is selected.

The first charity drive ended in mid-March, and over $2200 was donated to Operation Kindness. The current drive has been underway for nearly 3 weeks, and is expected to end near the end of April, at which point all charity wallet profits from the current period will be donated to Morris Animal Refuge. The owner of Morris Animal Refuge is reportedly planning a live event to receive the donation in-person from a CHOW representative, who will be flying out to Philadelphia for that purpose. The refuge has apparently successfully held such events before, which double as opportunities for attendees from all over the state to adopt their animals.

The third charity drive partner will be decided after the conclusion of the second charity drive.

# The Team

Chow is a community-driven project, and the team is thus made up of volunteers from the community. There are no dev wallets; any CHOW holdings that team members have were purchased on the open market like anybody else. The early volunteers donated their own CHOW to build up the charity wallet that now accrues interest for charities. Many of the team members have spent money out of their own pockets to fund the development of the project and build up a marketing campaign. The team members have consistently shown dedication to the project by not selling at any of the various ATHs that have occurred. The team of volunteers is highly engaged with the community; in fact, it is hard to say where the community ends and the team begins. Ideas and suggestions brought up by the community are regularly considered and adopted by the team.

# Partnerships

In addition to being partnered with Operation Kindness and Morris Animal Refuge for the charity drives, CHOW is partnered with The Gem Hunters (with whom they are co-hosting an NFT contest): [https://twitter.com/ChowChowF/status/1375555125108862977?s=20](https://twitter.com/ChowChowF/status/1375555125108862977?s=20)

CHOW also recently announced a partnership with BetsPodcast and BTCVIX (ie: Satoshi Street Bets): [https://twitter.com/ChowChowF/status/1378075819730378757?s=20](https://twitter.com/ChowChowF/status/1378075819730378757?s=20)

# Potential FUD

**Why are there two tokens with the same contract? Won't this just dilute the original erc20 CHOW holders?**

The team has generally responded to these sorts of questions with the following points: volume on the ETH chain was being heavily suppressed by gas fees, so the introduction of the BSC token opens up the general CHOW project to small investors who can't afford gas while we wait for Uniswap 3 and Ethereum gas solutions. Many traders trade exclusively on ETH or on BSC, so this way they can all get in. Both tokens contribute to the same charities, so in the end, it all goes to the same place. 

The team believes that opening up to the BSC market will increase exposure to the overall CHOW project, which will help both tokens. They have pointed to $FEG as an example of a project that launched parallel tokens on these two chains, which seems to have led to an eventual price convergence, and an overall massive boost to both tokens and the project as a whole.

**How do we know we won't get rugged?**

Rug pulls are everywhere nowadays, and we've all got to tread carefully. After following this project for the last month, I have become pretty convinced there is no rug in store. First of all, note that the liquidity pools are 100% locked. Also, there are no developer or team wallets. 

Of course, the volunteers that make up the team have personal wallets, and some of them have substantial holdings. Like with all projects, there is technically nothing guaranteeing that they don't sell at some point and cause the price to tumble. However, it is worth noting that their wallets are watched by the community, and they have not sold at previous opportunities when CHOW has hit ATHs. Regardless of the ebb and flow of CHOW prices, the team has simply continued to consistently work on growing the project. 

The most convincing point for me, though, is that the team of volunteers has paid for CHOW's growth and marketing entirely out of their own pockets, and have volunteered countless hours of their own time to the project. It would be counterintuitive for them to rug the very project they have being pouring their own time and money into. 

**Isn't CHOW merely yet another charity redistribution meme coin?**

Well, the simplest answer is CHOW was the first. In the weeks after it launched in early February, clones and spinoffs with nearly identical tokenomics began popping up, literally by the dozen. Some of those have done well, and are still standing. Others were pumped and dumped and abandoned; still others were rugged before even making it off the ground. One of the most major of these projects not only copied the CHOW idea, but created a near clone of CHOW's website. After going through a meteoric rise, this project crumbled into obscurity.

Of course, being first doesn't make anything best. But CHOW has proven that it has staying power. It has weathered all the crests and troughs of its price waves without the team selling out or slowing development. In the tortoise and the hare parable, CHOW is the tortoise,  It has not yet seen a meteoric rise like many of its peers; this might seem like a negative, but all it really means is that it still has great potential upside. The project has continued to grow, irrespective of market sentiment. In the short term, markets are mostly noise. In the long term, however, prices always converge on project quality. Therefore, so long as the teams maintains the steady, consistent project growth that we have been seeing, I feel very comfortable holding this asset through its low market cap early days.

CHOW is the original charity redistribution coin. It raises money through transactions fees and then donates those funds to charity. It is a community-driven project based on a wholesome community. It is a meme coin with a heart. In short, I like the coin.

* He basically copied and pasted the TRON whitepaper word-for-word from other several other ""ETH killer"" whitepapers.
* Tron itself is an Ethereum clone with a questionable network. [HackerOne found](https://hackerone.com/reports/479144) one machine could unleash a DDoS attack powerful enough to take down the entire network, while several people ([including Tron's ex-CTO](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/tron-is-a-highly-centralized-project-ex-cto-says/)) have noted that the network is heavily centralized due to the TRON foundation owning so many super representatives, a la the Binance Smart Chain. As recently as November, the TRON Foundation was able to [halt block creation to address a malicious contract bug](https://cryptobriefing.com/tron-mainnet-suffers-attack-brings-block-production-halt/), further illustrating its centralization.
* People aren't a fan of his marketing antics. He's well known for [paying celebrities and influences to promote TRON without disclosure](https://twitter.com/lindsaylohan/status/1359939980739624970) and also spends Foundation money on stuff like luxury office spaces, giving away Teslas and $5 million dinners with Warren Buffet.
* After acquiring BitTorrent, most of the original BitTorrent team quit, with the founder specifically [criticizing Sun as a typical narcissistic tech biz dev guy who cares more about realization of his ""vision"" than creating a good technology product](https://twitter.com/bramcohen/status/1311360099680579584?lang=en).

As an aside, I actually tried to use BTT when it launched in 2019, since I had been dumb enough to buy Tron after the crash and got it airdropped. It was shit and I reverted instantly back to an older version. 

It straight up didn't work and didn't count your upload accurately, making earning BTT harder. But of course, it would accurately track BTT spend, encouraging you to buy more. Never once had an issue with BitTorrent in the 10+ years I used it before the TRON acquisition, BTT adds friction to the user experience simply to justify the token. No thanks.",ethereum,1

SCT - Clash Token is at around 1.6 mill mcap. It already has public alpha of the game on Steam, amazing NFT artwork through 20 different artists, at a very low microcap and it has been retweeted by Enjin an hour ago! It also offers farming with insane apr's which gives SCP to buy NFTs with. With farming, nearly 1/3rd of SCT circulating supply is staked so low supply on the market. Marketing is scheduled for later this month and May.

**SCT - Clash Tokens**

Spirit Clash is a TCG developed under Koltiro Games LLC. Built on Ethereum, powered (and adopted by) Enjin, Spirit Clash allows for true asset ownership by leveraging the ERC-1155 token standard. Sharing similarities with other popular TCGs, Spirit Clash also provides a unique twist by requiring you to attack your opponents three cores: Mind, Body, and Soul.

Clash Token - $SCT will be used to stake or farm for booster packs for the game, staking already active. SCT is also the only way to purchase a season pass, which will grant access to season-based rewards, challenges, and incredibly rare NFTs for the most daring.

**Highlights:**

\-Official Enjin adopted game

\-Partners with SPI shopping.io

\-Doxxed team

\- Jumpnet about to be implemented for zero fees NFT transfers

\-Mr. Bill (Mau5trap/Billegal Beats) is our sound dev

\- Public alpha for the game released and on Steam

\- Staking released with insane APYs

\-Locked liquidity and team funds [https://etherscan.io/address/0xec6084462e330387ced0864677095b00e92ca3fc](https://etherscan.io/address/0xec6084462e330387ced0864677095b00e92ca3fc)

**Total Supply:** 10 mill (8 million tokens burnt) - 1.495 circulating and total supply now 1.995 mill

I Heard Bitcoin could go to $1 million then, and instead of bitching about how ridiculous the prediction was, I read the articles making the statement, ran the numbers behind their logic myself, and verified the numbers; then I realized $1 million was extremely conservative when I ran the numbers myself, and that the real stabilization number where Bitcoin's growth would slow and resemble the current tech stock market would be something more like 10 million+. And even then that's nowhere near where the math stops, that's just where it stabilizes to the point where then countries can jump in without being able to spike, tank, or drain the market.

But arriving to the sending page, I saw a very clean **15â‚¬** (**$18**).

Well, OK. I saw here that Ethereum fees lately are very high and that they are working on it.

Alright, guess it's time to go back to BTC. Fees =&gt; **0.0005 BTC** (around **25â‚¬, \~$30**).

There's no way I send like **25%** of my amount in fees.

I also do not see it as much of an issue because you can use cash and that is relatively untraceable.

But, I think the government wants it set up so that if you want to use it for certain things you will have to convert it to Bitcoin or Ethereum and then they can trace the fact that it existed at one point.

But, yea monero is probably going to go through some growing pains.  Not saying it is wrong or right.  But, if people could get around the government as easily as just trading in Monero with no issues...it would really screw with the show.

Of course, there are shitcoins and scams that sometimes manage to fulfill everything, and even good projects sometimes don't work out so as always, spread the risk by not putting all your eggs in a basket.

This includes currencies/tokens, defi products, staking, and even investment products on exchanges.

I would appreciate it if others could comment if anything is missing. Of course, I wish this would live in a wiki that everyone could add to it, but right now, I don't have better ideas where to publish it.

* Check how the project is useful and what value does it provide. Go through the documentation and whitepaper. You should be looking for things that creating value or have a utility, so there would be a continuous and growing demand for the project. If you don't understand, you can always ask them, and it would be a great chance to see how is their support.
* If the project is live check the current metrics of how much of the token is used/locked/burned. Check to see how it is different from other implementations that solve the same problem if that applies.
* Check to see if they have open-sourced their code. Check to see how frequently they make changes to the code repositories. Nothing is ever finished, and there's always room for improvement.
* If the project is just a currency with a promise of delivering value for the future, check to see if they have a testnet and try to see what's done and what's not. You can ask their devs for the current status.
* Check to see which companies backing the project. Google them with the company name to see if you can find some news from the companies. Projects with big investors behind them means someone else did this research and found out it was good.
* Check to see the team behind the project. Find out what did they work on before this. You can check their Linkedin.
* If it's a currency, check the current supply for it. Check what's the emission or burn schedule if any. Find out to see how much of it is allocated to what. If there's a constant emission, check if people are locking it in constantly(for example one reason Ethereum value rise even though there's a constant emission is because people lock it in DeFI apps)
* Via the blockexplorer you can find which addresses have the highest amount and you can ask the team about it. You want to make sure if the team decided to raise money and cash out their holdings, it wouldn't tank the coin causing everyone to panic and sell.
* Check the current and future market cap and compare it to other projects. If it's too high, expect the value to fall.
* If it's a token mainly for governance(to vote on proposals), compare the market cap/TVL ratio(you can find it on coingecko) with other governance tokens. The higher the ratio, the more of the token is held by speculators who are not gonna use it to vote and simply cash out when the value is high enough. You want to the value to be driven out of utility and not out of speculators.
* If you are investing in a DEFI product and the project has a governance token, find out how much one would need to buy the governance token and use that to vote in proposals that would not be in your interest. Check earlier proposals and see how much was voted. It should be too expensive to buy enough of the token and change the outcome of proposals. Check to see previous proposals and how much people voted. You can compare this usage with other similar projects for more insights. A governance token is useless if there's no proposals or if people aren't interested to vote in proposals.
* Find out the attack vectors of the projects. If it's a proof of stake currency, how much one needs to do successful attacks. Or if it's proof of work check to see how much resources an adversary needs for a successful attack.
* Check to see if the project/exchange is audited and which third-party audited them.
* Check to see if there has been (attempted) attacks/hacks on the project/exchange. See they have reacted and how did it survive the hack. Good examples are doing more audits, covering users losses, plugging the holes immediately, providing updates(Binance). Bad examples are locking withdrawals for extended periods of time and doing shady things(Kucoin).
* Check the project roadmap, see if the the stuff on the roadmap(short-term and long-term) make sense and provide value and utility.
* Check their old roadmaps and see how did they achieve their goals. It's normal though, for projects to overestimate their ability and not deliver on time, but it definitely shouldn't be that they didn't deliver anything at all.
* Check their social media, not just the ones that the project advertises, also find the ones the community around them has created. I normally find good non-official groups on Telegram. Look to see what people are complaining about. Look to see if the traders are holding or looking for short term profits.
* Check to see how the project evolved, how that changed their trading volumes/usage/social media following.
* At least make a rough investment plan, which should include how much and how frequently you would be investing, for how long, when you would take profits and what are the costs are. Don't forget gas costs for both supplying and withdrawing for DEFI projects. For most investment products(exchange or DEFI) the APY is not constant and things with high APY don't last long. Find out how do they change, what affects them and when do they end. Calculate how much would be your true return.
* In the case that you have to your lock your tokens for a certain amount of time, check to see how much is a penalty for early withdrawal and check if you can short the token to hedge the risk if you couldn't withdraw.
* If it's a token, check to see which centralized exchanges you can buy it from. Normally big centralized exchanges would do some research before listing(not Hotbit) to make sure the coin is not a scam.

What blockchain needs is simplification. Both in naming conventions (personally I think blockchain is a clunky word, when compared to something like internet), but primarily in ease of use. My dad needs to be able to use the tech. And he can barely operate an iPhone. Then it will really get big.

The potential is there in terms of scale. The bar to entry has to be lowered into the ground though.

t1_gtho2ko,"Let me tell you why tron is better than 99% of the other cryptocurrencies out there.

Firstly, tron has a LOT of users. There isn't much 'hype' as you say, because if there was, no other crypto would match up to tron. The main thing about tron blockchain is that it is undervalued. Yes, the developer documentations and opportunities on tron right now aren't great, but that is only because most people build on blockchains like ethereum.

Tron gives you a number of free transactions. They don't have a specific number, but TRX and TRC-10 tokens take something known as bandwidth. You're given 5000 bandwidth, replenishing over 24 hours. This allows you to transfer values as low as 1 sun (10\^-6 trx) without any transaction fees whatsoever. Just like ethereum, TRC20 tokens, however are based on smart contracts. Even this can be made free by freezing. Freezing TRX allows you to gain resources, either bandwidth or energy currently. You can get energy, and triggering smart contracts for anything will take energy and bandwidth. So if you have enough trx, you can freeze, or buy energy for free or cheaper transactions. Plus with the low value of tron, this amount is almost non existent. A normal transfer on eth or btc can cost a few dollars, or even more.

Tron supports smart contracts, like ethereum. Tron is faster (approximate block verification time is 1.5 mins according to my experience) which makes the transactions almost instant. This speed and low transaction fees cannot be seen in most crypto currencies. And the one's who do have this, they don't have smart contracts.

As for the future growth, tron has just launched the TRC721 (NFT) token, just like ERC721 (NFT). Apart from this, you mentioned that "" it doesnt matter if you have a scarce token when it cannot do much."", but many exchanges have started taking tron natively. And with the price increase, it is very possible that it might catch the eye of more of these exchanges and payment gateways.

&amp;#x200B;

I completely disagree that the price increase is because of 'hype' in the community, but because tron is starting to gain the recognition it truly deserves

t3_mkl1y4,"Meliora ($MORA) is a cross-chain swap platform; a DEX (with order book) that will allow swaps across chains (Ethereum, Cosmos, BSC, DOT, AVAX etc). This is right on point for the cross-chain stage we're entering into, and the hype around projects that can deliver cross-chain tech will be massive.

Atomic swaps are the gold standard of cross-chain transactions, and Meliora's proposed solution looks promising. The combination of AMM-style always-on incentivized liquidity with an order book and cross-chain capability is a legit gamechanger.

For tech overview start here: [https://meliorafinance.medium.com/the-blockchain-industry-which-began-with-bitcoin-is-basically-a-component-of-the-financial-d487a2a1efda](https://meliorafinance.medium.com/the-blockchain-industry-which-began-with-bitcoin-is-basically-a-component-of-the-financial-d487a2a1efda)

The MORA token can be staked (50-90% staking APY depending on the amount of MORA held), offer Revenue Sharing of all the protocol's transaction fees (requires 5k+ MORA), provide governance, and offer trading fee discounts.

MORA currently sits at around 2-3m market cap, with 2.3m MORA tokens in circulation. 1m MORA tokens will be available as staking rewards during the next 5 months. (any unawarded $MORA will be burned forever - medium article link below).

The team is semi-anon. They KYCed to their investor (Pinpoint Capital) and to Dextools. The code has also been audited by Solidity Finance, to give investors confidence in such a small, early project.

\*\*Further details\*\*

Meliora did their presale at .45 , which hit hard cap (380 ETH) and sold out in under 2 minutes. They then launched at .50 and have been ranging between 1.00-2.00, with a momentary ath of 2.50. Right now its bouncing around support at $1.10, give or take a few cents. Thats only around 2x listing and only 3x presale.

Around 20% of the supply is currently locked up in staking, and that number is only going up. The liquidity pool depth on uni is around 400k, which is close to nothing. Weâ€™re currently just under 1,000 holders but this is continuing to grow everyday. There is a small, active community on Twitter and on the Telegram group, so at the moment its still under the radar. The team has not started any real marketing yet - just a quick AMA on Gem Hunters.

These conditions are overall extremely bullish in my opinion. The moment this thing gets attention, it will shatter the $2.50 ath. And once it does start to move, the staking feature will be even more valuable. Even if you only scoop enough to earn the 50% staking tier, and it conservatively only goes 3x in the near term (which is VERY conservative, given the supply constraints and lack of attention) then you'll be getting around 80 MORA/month for staking, which would be valued at approx $240, potentially. Hard to beat on a microcap.

Good luck everybody! DYOR

t3_mkxfo7,"NII has been on my radar for a while and recently started getting INSANE traction on Uniswap. Nahmii is a Layer-2 scaling protocol for the Ethereum blockchain.

You guys can google Nahmii to read about the project; I'll tell you why I think it's a moonshot even after 10Xing in the past few days.

NII is still under 1000 holders, yet has $5,000,000 liquidity and $6,000,000 24 hour volume on Uniswap. The official telegram was locked a month ago by the team in preparation for a series of big announcements. The only reason I can think of for them to do this would be to prevent any leaks getting out about massive partnerships with serious organizations. Further, look at the Uniswap activity- the people buying this token today are mostly whales. Buys of $25k+ are the norm for this token right now. Seems like the smart money is flocking to NII, and something HUGE is imminent.

I can only speculate, but the above has me thinking that the Nahmii team may have came up with an L2 solution that is actually revolutionary for the ETH blockchain, and will be supported officially by some huge names. The only rumors I could find on telegram point to Microsoft and the Ethereum Foundation itself.

With Burst you hold your own non custodian wallet in your own hands. Your crypto, your keys. There is a Burst presale happening till the 31st of April and you can get your hands on some $BURST.

Burst is launching on Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) and Ethereum chain (ERC20) at the same time. No other presale are attempting to launch mutli-chain right now. This gives the project a strong start before even getting to get its wings as weâ€™ve seen BSC become the solution to many peoples problems with current gas fees.

Burst has an all-device ready non custodial wallet build from the start so you can use cryptocurrencies in the way that crypto was intended to be used - in a secure manner. No exchange or platform wallet to hold your funds.

The platform features native atomic swaps from the get go and tokens can be traded for major cryptos on the platform. It will also support a P2P trade function on the platform. Burst will also host swaps between major cryptos with only a key-pair required

The platform will host an NFT marketplace to become an NFT DEX. Burst believes there is a bright future in NFTâ€™s and the project is only beginning to explore just now. To stay ahead of the curve, the NFT marketplace will be launched to be able to capture value through various means.

Burst is looking to expand into payment processing as a token to settle payments. Utilizing the Non Custodian Wallet mobile app users can settle payments with on the go, as well as access DeFi products from anywhere in the world.

Join the presale at [Burst.Money](https://Burst.Money) to take part in the DeFi action before the herd.

They way Altcoin is currently employed usually means everything not-bitcoin. I can get some of the sentiment behind this. With BTC consistently adding more than 50% market dominance, it can be argued that everything not-bitcoin is just an alternative to it.

But I think this can be a little misleading. 

* Firstly, not all alternatives are the same. 
* Secondly, alternative can also mean, usually in arts and culture, that which is more niche, with a smaller devoted fan-base or what goes against the popular norm.

Now, when I think about some other projects, such as Ethereum, I find it rather strange that a project so ubiquitous and dominant in the Crypto industry is still called ""alternative"". The same goes for important and well established defi infrastructure projects such as ChainLink, old and reliable ones like Monero, or even those tied to important exchanges such as Binance Coin, that do not seem to be going away anytime soon. If such projects are ""alternative"" only on the basis of being not-bitcoin, I think we are not painting a very complete picture.

I think that we could adopt something a bit more precise to talk about these projects, perhaps according to use (such as what is already done with stablecoins) or something according to their relative importance in the market like Majorcoin, Solidcoin or whatever (I'm sure much better names will be proposed).

Maybe this is just a very minor gripe and not very important in the grand scheme of things. Maybe we can do with just Altcoins, Shitcoins and Stablecoins. But I think that, as the market grows and different projects secure their place in different niches, these three definitions will no longer suffice.

What are your thoughts?",ethereum,1
t3_mku7rs,"On Monday 5th April 2021, the CEO of Smartlands answered questions at an AMA session on [r/stellarbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarbets/).  

This post collects all of the questions and answers into an easy to ready format.  

**Q1.** **Hey! Wondering if we could learn more about the expected launch date, and what to expect on that day you do launch?**  

*We are planning to announce the launch date and the main stages of the project in a couple of days. In the same release, we will cover what to expect on the launch day, too. We have to sort the licensing first.*  

**Q2. In 2020, researchers from Oxford University published a paper called** [**""Tokenization: The Future of Real Estate**](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-01/tokenisation.pdf)**?"". The paper suggests that the future of tokenizing real estate looks ""promising,"" though it also listed a couple of challenges:**  

**""First, there needs to be an expressed demand for the fractionalisation of single real estate assets. Evidence of this is at best sketchy, both through history and in the current period. Second, market participants need to be comfortable with blockchain, the digital underpinning of tokenisation.""**  

**Do you view these as challenges, and if so, how is Smartlands working to overcome them in Ukraine?**  

**Similarly, the researchers seemed very keen on the idea of tokenizing debt markets, calling it an area ""of significant promise."" Can you provide a rough idea of the opportunities within this space, and the hurdles that need to be overcome before Smartlands can take advantage of them?**  

*Debt markets are certainly also interested, although in our opinion not so promising as equity. We plan to add debt opportunities on the platform after the launch, in about the 2nd half of 2021.*  

*Regarding the challenges for the tokenization, we don't see the problems mentioned in the Oxford report in Ukraine. In our opinion, the biggest challenge is the integration of the tokenized assets into the existing capital markets ecosystem (listing on traditional stock exchanges, ability to put tokens into collateral in a bank, etc.) and that can be solved only with specific legislation, like the one that is coming in Ukraine.*  

**Q3.** **After you launch in Ukraine, will you be expanding your product range eg Art or will you be targeting launching in the UK?**  

*We're considering building several ""arms"" in our ecosystem - real estate, agriculture, art and collectibles, SMEs, and startups.*  

*We will start our alternative investment platform slowly, with only real estate, but will gradually add other asset classes as the investment capacity grows.*  

**Q4.** **At this point, can you give us more details about the expansion of the Agroxy platform?**  

*After thorough planning with multiple stakeholders, we're moving towards a more close partnership with Agroxy, and building a comprehensive ecosystem for farmers, not only including trading of farm produces, but also investments, payments, etc. We can't disclose much around it, as the details are still being negotiated and we don't have approval from other stakeholders in the project, but we will update our community as soon as there will be a solid agreement.*  

**Q5.** **What makes Smartlands better than any other platform trying to tokenize real-estate?**  

*We're for a long time in this market and almost certainly have a level of expertise bigger than of any new platform. Besides that, we're uniquely positioned as not only a tech company with one of the best tokenization technology but also we're the first client of our own tech with the regulated alternative investment business.*  

*And our business and plans are far bigger than just real assets tokenization, more towards the concept of investment banking. E.g. we not only tokenize and list, but attracting investments, and for some asset classes plan even to provide a closed comprehensive ecosystem (agriculture).*  

**Q6. Will there be KYC requirements for staking SLT and are there going to be restrictions on who can stake as a result? (i.e New York where there are heavy financial regulations)?**  

*I can't yet give a certain answer about NY, but our ultimate goal is to allow staking for every investor.*  

*Investors will need to hold the staked tokens in the regulated environment (Smartlands wallet), and we plan to require KYC only for investments (however that might change as our legal team goes through all the questions).*  

**Q7.** **Do you have any plans for marketing videos on YouTube that explains your product, fee structure and how the SLT utility token is used in your product for better transparency and user reach?**  

*Smartlands Youtube channel will be active very soon, and we plan to build a solid presence here. With good quality content and speakers. Considering Russian and English-speaking audiences, and most probably will make the content for both.*  

*Overall, video content gives a unique educational opportunity and this will be one of the most important arms in the marketing of alternative investments.*  

**Q8.** **What is the status of the Smartlands Wallet? Will it be compatible with Ledger and Trezor?**  

*Smartlands Wallet, as well as the whole platform, is currently under a major overhaul.*  

*Although the tokenization core was built as state-of-the-art for our UK adventure, the UI/UX/visual part was under the acceptance threshold, and that's where we concentrated our efforts now. So expect to see a good-looking solid platform, combining all the components into a very sexy and convenient UI.*  

*For the wallet part, we see the big potential in streamlining the user experience by allowing to sign in with email and password (similar to what StellarX provides), but hardware wallets will also be supported for the increased security.*  

*Ledger wallet support should be ready immediately with the wallet launch (or a few weeks later), and Trezor support is in the backlog and will be available later, about Q3.*  

**Q9.** **I heard that there are around 5-6 million tokens that are being held off from the public, is this true, and if itâ€™s true do yâ€™all have any plans to gradually release them into the public or do you plan on just holding them?**  

*The stats on CoinMarketCap are in general correct. There is \~7.1 million max supply, and \~5.5 circulating (was 5.1 prior to our investment into the Ukrainian licensed company). The number of tokens in circulation will be adjusted on the public release of the news regarding the status of our license in Ukraine.*  

*All the company tokens are unlocked from the escrow contract according to the T&amp;C of the crowd sale (within 3 years), but we're planning to continue to hold them at least until we have a really solid natural demand for the token from multiple sources and jurisdictions.*  

**Q10.** **It is well known and understood that the first iteration of Smartlands and tokenization project in the UK could be seen as a pilot project of sorts. Brexit and the ultimate bear market forced a pivoting point in Smartlands - what are your two or three most important takeaways/lessons learned from that pilot project and how do you plan to implement these lessons within the framework of the platform launch in Ukraine?**  

**Secondly, Do you see any barriers of entry beyond the legal and regulatory frameworks or hurdles? What do you feel is your biggest hurdle/most challenging barrier of entry ?**  

**Thanks, with much love and belief in the project. We are rooting for you guys!**  

*Thank you for the words of support; it meant a lot for the whole team! We certainly learned from the pilot and based on that knowledge, we are designing our alternative investment project now. The main takeaways are:*  

*- We now more focus on the secondary market and an ability to put the tokens into collateral, as these turned to be the key points for institutionals;*  

*- The retail audience we plan to target now is not the same. Previously we targeted crypto enthusiasts worldwide, and now the focus of the main campaign for the retail stage will be different. As in general crypto audience tends to trade and get the benefits now, we need those who prefer a long-term investment;*  

*- We focus on the jurisdiction more friendly for tokenized real assets, as this allows to cut off the unnecessary middlemen, make tokens more transparent and secure, and allows streamlined integration into a traditional finance ecosystem.*  

*The most significant barrier so far is still the regulation and waiting for the new law on digital assets to come into full force. However, as I told in the Sam Conner AMA, the process will be ""iterational"", and we will gradually release all the features.*  

**Q11.** **What are some major roadblocks that could potentially hurt progress on the project? I always see people singing praises of SLT, but I get skeptical when there are only pros and no cons to discuss.**  

**i.e. with the 1000â‚¬ requirement to stake, is there something that could impact a change to this plan for holders?**  

*We don't foresee any significant roadblocks, but until the project is a successful and profitable global enterprise, all the startup risks are applied (however, to a major extent these risks are mitigated as we already are an experienced team and understand all the needs of the market).*  

*Regarding the staking, we don't foresee any problems in implementing this rule, and holders will always be allowed to change the desired amount through on-chain voting.*  

**Q12.** **Is there any news on when the Smartlands platform will go online?**  

*soonâ„¢*  
*:)*  

**Q13.** **What is the biggest misinformation about Smartlands that you have seen?**  

*Stolen logo :D*  

**Q14.** **Can you maybe explain, in just a few simple sentences, how you ensure consistency between on-chain tokens and off-chain assets? I am thinking about some unexpected events that can befell on advertised buildings/properties (case of fire, earthquake, ...). How is this monitored and reflected on blockchain issued tokens?**  

*Thanks for the question, it is really an important aspect.*  

*Naturally, the equity tokens will provide all the same rights as the ""paper"" equity shares. That will be governed by the regulator and big partner banks and custodians.*  

*Thus, the ownership of the property won't change in any event. And talking about the price of the tokens, it also shouldn't drop significantly, as the building naturally should be insured.*  

**Q15.** **Who do you consider is our biggest competitor in this space and why?**  

*There are a lot of DeFi projects, but I believe that we compete with the investments in general. We are trying to solve the issues of the current system and give people a cheaper, safe and more beneficial way to invest. Itâ€™s the best way to deliver some value. And if there are some similar projects, we are more than happy that this market is becoming more prominent and popular.*  

**Q16.** **Are you at all concerned about the recent news of a Russian military presence pushing closer to Ukraine's border, and if so do you feel that Ukraine getting closer to a decentralized economy has anything to do with that?**  

**Also, if someone wanted to get involved in helping the process of expanding Smartlands tokenization to new nations, such as Mexico, how would one go about that?**  

**Also, will the staking minimum of 1000 euro be changed or clarified into a SLT balance?**  

*Thank for the questions!*  

1. *The Ukraine-Russian relationship, Itâ€™s the same as global warming; we canâ€™t change it at once, but we are taking all possible measures in order to prevent future problems. Our platform is safe and eco-friendly :)*  
2. *Expansion - we're currently concentrating our own business activities around Ukraine, Liechtenstein, and to some extent - UK, Germany, Switzerland, and Baltic states. We envision as the natural way for our expansion through local JVs with financial institutions/entrepreneurs, willing to dive deep into the regulatory/licensing questions.*  
3. *We envision it will be always tied to the fiat value, as this should be convenient. However, it might be changed through the voting of token holders.*  

**Q17.** **Cruncher's prophecy is still holding up. What are your thoughts about that? ðŸ˜‰**  

*Intuition is normally based on knowledge and experience :)*  

**Q18.** **Honest question here - if the normal person out there sees that it runs on the Stellar platform, why not just use lumens instead of Smartlands Token?**  

*Thanks for the question, I think that is really important to explain.*  

*The explanation however is simple - it's not about the underlying blockchain or settlement layer (it can be Stellar, Ethereum, Cosmos, or even Bitcoin - most probably all of these blockchains will be used in our global ecosystem on the distance 5-10 years) - it is about our technology and smart contracts for meeting all the compliance and regulatory requirement, KYC, limits, settlement, utility functions, etc.*  

*All these processes will require some fees, and according to the Smartlands Whitepaper and token sale T&amp;C, we're bound to make the only possible way to pay fees on the platform in SLT token.*  

**Q19.** **What is your teams shared drive that is making you all want to succeed?**  

**Could you also please explain the best thing the team has done so far and one thing the team could have done slightly better?**  

*Maybe it sounds too simple, but we really believe that we can change the current state of things, and the more we do, the more we see the support from our army of believers (our community), the easier it gets.*  

*The best thing is that we all gathered in our effort, and everyone does his/her part properly. Itâ€™s both - the luck that itâ€™s us - Martin Birch, me, Inna, Natalia, Danylo, Viktor, and the rest of the office, and the experience and effort of everyone. The best we could do is to find each other several months earlier.*  

**Q20.** **How soon do you expect to have your Ukranian license? Has there been any challenges in the process of obtaining it?**  

*No major challenges, only a few delays due to COVID - in Ukraine currently there is the big 2nd wave.*  

*The license should be ready in the coming weeks.*  

**Q21.** **I am very excited for this AMA! ðŸ™ˆThanks** [**u/ilia\_smartlands**](https://www.reddit.com/u/ilia_smartlands/) **for accepting the invite to host an AMA for Stellar community! ðŸ¾**  

**I only have a simple question for you. Iâ€™ll leave the burning questions to others. What is your comfort food? â˜ºï¸**  

*Many thanks for this event from me personally, and from all our team!*  

*Last year I turned vegetarian (although not strict, just not eating/cooking meat at least at home and with family), and this was quite a big boost for productivity.*  

*To mention some good example of what I eat, I'd prefer potato pancake with salted salmon and sour cream :)*  

**Q22.** **What's your marketing strategy? Is it a big marketing campaign, or are you talking to specific businesses that look like they could be interested?**  

*Thanks for the questions. Regarding the marketing campaign, as the first step we will open the platform for institutional investors, and this process is already full steam on face-to-face meetings.*  

*Then we will open the venue for retail investors in Ukraine, and that's where the local marketing will kick in. Besides the wide campaign of digital marketing, we also rely here on the large customer support and acquisition team and call center.*  

**Q23. Could you give us a breakdown of token distribution?**  

*Thanks for the question!*  

*7.1M total/max supply;*    
*5.5M circulating.*  

*Among the tokens not in circulation - 66% is the company treasury for long-term motivation (options) and partnerships, and 33% is the budget for direct investments.*  

**Q24.** **Can you tell us why you are so passionate about smartlands, tokenization and the future of them both?**  

*Thanks for the question!*  

*The answer although is quite simple :) I really believe that this solution must exist, to allow all the people worldwide, no matter their net worth or income, to invest on the transparent platform, into profitable real economy assets that are just simply not available currently.*  

*I personally find Smartlands and participated in the first token sale as an investor, for a reason - I found Smartlands and had an ""aha"" moment, knowing that such a platform will solve my personal problems and problems of all similar to me - IT professionals.*  

**Q25.** **Do you have any news on the T1 exchange that SLT will be listed on?**  

*Coming soon, exchange selected, and the process already ongoing.*  

*Although please not expect before the platform and staking launch.*",bitcoin,1
t3_mku7rs,"On Monday 5th April 2021, the CEO of Smartlands answered questions at an AMA session on [r/stellarbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarbets/).  

This post collects all of the questions and answers into an easy to ready format.  

**Q1.** **Hey! Wondering if we could learn more about the expected launch date, and what to expect on that day you do launch?**  

*We are planning to announce the launch date and the main stages of the project in a couple of days. In the same release, we will cover what to expect on the launch day, too. We have to sort the licensing first.*  

**Q2. In 2020, researchers from Oxford University published a paper called** [**""Tokenization: The Future of Real Estate**](https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-01/tokenisation.pdf)**?"". The paper suggests that the future of tokenizing real estate looks ""promising,"" though it also listed a couple of challenges:**  

**""First, there needs to be an expressed demand for the fractionalisation of single real estate assets. Evidence of this is at best sketchy, both through history and in the current period. Second, market participants need to be comfortable with blockchain, the digital underpinning of tokenisation.""**  

**Do you view these as challenges, and if so, how is Smartlands working to overcome them in Ukraine?**  

**Similarly, the researchers seemed very keen on the idea of tokenizing debt markets, calling it an area ""of significant promise."" Can you provide a rough idea of the opportunities within this space, and the hurdles that need to be overcome before Smartlands can take advantage of them?**  

*Debt markets are certainly also interested, although in our opinion not so promising as equity. We plan to add debt opportunities on the platform after the launch, in about the 2nd half of 2021.*  

*Regarding the challenges for the tokenization, we don't see the problems mentioned in the Oxford report in Ukraine. In our opinion, the biggest challenge is the integration of the tokenized assets into the existing capital markets ecosystem (listing on traditional stock exchanges, ability to put tokens into collateral in a bank, etc.) and that can be solved only with specific legislation, like the one that is coming in Ukraine.*  

**Q3.** **After you launch in Ukraine, will you be expanding your product range eg Art or will you be targeting launching in the UK?**  

*We're considering building several ""arms"" in our ecosystem - real estate, agriculture, art and collectibles, SMEs, and startups.*  

*We will start our alternative investment platform slowly, with only real estate, but will gradually add other asset classes as the investment capacity grows.*  

**Q4.** **At this point, can you give us more details about the expansion of the Agroxy platform?**  

*After thorough planning with multiple stakeholders, we're moving towards a more close partnership with Agroxy, and building a comprehensive ecosystem for farmers, not only including trading of farm produces, but also investments, payments, etc. We can't disclose much around it, as the details are still being negotiated and we don't have approval from other stakeholders in the project, but we will update our community as soon as there will be a solid agreement.*  

**Q5.** **What makes Smartlands better than any other platform trying to tokenize real-estate?**  

*We're for a long time in this market and almost certainly have a level of expertise bigger than of any new platform. Besides that, we're uniquely positioned as not only a tech company with one of the best tokenization technology but also we're the first client of our own tech with the regulated alternative investment business.*  

*And our business and plans are far bigger than just real assets tokenization, more towards the concept of investment banking. E.g. we not only tokenize and list, but attracting investments, and for some asset classes plan even to provide a closed comprehensive ecosystem (agriculture).*  

**Q6. Will there be KYC requirements for staking SLT and are there going to be restrictions on who can stake as a result? (i.e New York where there are heavy financial regulations)?**  

*I can't yet give a certain answer about NY, but our ultimate goal is to allow staking for every investor.*  

*Investors will need to hold the staked tokens in the regulated environment (Smartlands wallet), and we plan to require KYC only for investments (however that might change as our legal team goes through all the questions).*  

**Q7.** **Do you have any plans for marketing videos on YouTube that explains your product, fee structure and how the SLT utility token is used in your product for better transparency and user reach?**  

*Smartlands Youtube channel will be active very soon, and we plan to build a solid presence here. With good quality content and speakers. Considering Russian and English-speaking audiences, and most probably will make the content for both.*  

*Overall, video content gives a unique educational opportunity and this will be one of the most important arms in the marketing of alternative investments.*  

**Q8.** **What is the status of the Smartlands Wallet? Will it be compatible with Ledger and Trezor?**  

*Smartlands Wallet, as well as the whole platform, is currently under a major overhaul.*  

*Although the tokenization core was built as state-of-the-art for our UK adventure, the UI/UX/visual part was under the acceptance threshold, and that's where we concentrated our efforts now. So expect to see a good-looking solid platform, combining all the components into a very sexy and convenient UI.*  

*For the wallet part, we see the big potential in streamlining the user experience by allowing to sign in with email and password (similar to what StellarX provides), but hardware wallets will also be supported for the increased security.*  

*Ledger wallet support should be ready immediately with the wallet launch (or a few weeks later), and Trezor support is in the backlog and will be available later, about Q3.*  

**Q9.** **I heard that there are around 5-6 million tokens that are being held off from the public, is this true, and if itâ€™s true do yâ€™all have any plans to gradually release them into the public or do you plan on just holding them?**  

*The stats on CoinMarketCap are in general correct. There is \~7.1 million max supply, and \~5.5 circulating (was 5.1 prior to our investment into the Ukrainian licensed company). The number of tokens in circulation will be adjusted on the public release of the news regarding the status of our license in Ukraine.*  

*All the company tokens are unlocked from the escrow contract according to the T&amp;C of the crowd sale (within 3 years), but we're planning to continue to hold them at least until we have a really solid natural demand for the token from multiple sources and jurisdictions.*  

**Q10.** **It is well known and understood that the first iteration of Smartlands and tokenization project in the UK could be seen as a pilot project of sorts. Brexit and the ultimate bear market forced a pivoting point in Smartlands - what are your two or three most important takeaways/lessons learned from that pilot project and how do you plan to implement these lessons within the framework of the platform launch in Ukraine?**  

**Secondly, Do you see any barriers of entry beyond the legal and regulatory frameworks or hurdles? What do you feel is your biggest hurdle/most challenging barrier of entry ?**  

**Thanks, with much love and belief in the project. We are rooting for you guys!**  

*Thank you for the words of support; it meant a lot for the whole team! We certainly learned from the pilot and based on that knowledge, we are designing our alternative investment project now. The main takeaways are:*  

*- We now more focus on the secondary market and an ability to put the tokens into collateral, as these turned to be the key points for institutionals;*  

*- The retail audience we plan to target now is not the same. Previously we targeted crypto enthusiasts worldwide, and now the focus of the main campaign for the retail stage will be different. As in general crypto audience tends to trade and get the benefits now, we need those who prefer a long-term investment;*  

*- We focus on the jurisdiction more friendly for tokenized real assets, as this allows to cut off the unnecessary middlemen, make tokens more transparent and secure, and allows streamlined integration into a traditional finance ecosystem.*  

*The most significant barrier so far is still the regulation and waiting for the new law on digital assets to come into full force. However, as I told in the Sam Conner AMA, the process will be ""iterational"", and we will gradually release all the features.*  

**Q11.** **What are some major roadblocks that could potentially hurt progress on the project? I always see people singing praises of SLT, but I get skeptical when there are only pros and no cons to discuss.**  

**i.e. with the 1000â‚¬ requirement to stake, is there something that could impact a change to this plan for holders?**  

*We don't foresee any significant roadblocks, but until the project is a successful and profitable global enterprise, all the startup risks are applied (however, to a major extent these risks are mitigated as we already are an experienced team and understand all the needs of the market).*  

*Regarding the staking, we don't foresee any problems in implementing this rule, and holders will always be allowed to change the desired amount through on-chain voting.*  

**Q12.** **Is there any news on when the Smartlands platform will go online?**  

*soonâ„¢*  
*:)*  

**Q13.** **What is the biggest misinformation about Smartlands that you have seen?**  

*Stolen logo :D*

Description:

EncrypGen is a decentralised genomic data marketplace, or in layman terms, a self-sovereign platform for the purchase and sale of genetic data for scientific research purposes. If you ever had a DNA test done (e.g. Ancestry.com, 23andme) chances are you were given the chance to sell your genetic data, these companies often sell this data to pharmaceutical firms for around $140 per individual. EncrypGen gives back control over your data and lets you profit from participation in genetic research. Pharmaceutical companies need to purchase $DNA tokens through the EncrypGen platform to use individualâ€™s data for research, and you profit from their purchase.

Currently, EncrypGen's database contains around 1,500 individual genetic profiles and brings around $300k revenue per year according to their SEC filings (https://sec.report/Document/0001780439-20-000057/). The company has recently partnered with African startup IndyGeneUS (relationship to Africa CDC/Microsoft) which will bring a whopping extra 19,000 genetic profile to the database. Furthermore, a bond offering raised another $200,000 for the company which they estimate will allow them to acquire another 10,000 genetic profiles.

The bigger the database, the more desirable it becomes to research companies, but to keep it conservative, the acquired datasets would translate to a revenue of about $5.8 million!

With a fixed/scarce supply of 71 million $DNA tokens (already fully distributed!) and tokenomics which directly correlate company revenue to token price (i.e. companies need to buy $DNA to access database), that would mean a possible 19300% token price increase, putting it at $1.25 by the end of the year minimum!

And even then, EncrypGen would still be an extremely low cap ($83m) compared to its less technologically advanced competitors such as 23andMe (valued at $3.5b), this is SOOOOOO EARLY!

Relationships/Partnerships:

EncrypGen has direct and indirect connections to:

ConSensys (creators of Metamask, co-founder of Ethereum) - EncrypGen's CEO Dr Koepsell is an advisor to ConSensys Health!

ConSensys Health recently joined DTRA with board members including AstraZeneca, Microsoft/Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Pfizer, Oracle, IBM Watson Health

Recognised by the World Economic Forum!

One of the only platforms fully compliant with the new data protection regulations on genetic data!

Market Cap $4 million whilst competitorâ€™s (23andMe) were recently valued at $3.5 billion

Genetic data market moves around $600 million in transactions every year, and it's only getting more popular

Huge database deal with IndyGeneUS for Q3 2021 (bringing 19,000 datasets to their database)

23andMe announced going public, and due to its genetic database of 10 million users it is valued at $3.5 billion.

Some of them have also realized, if youâ€™re self-employed, depending on where you are, you may be able to write off your mortgage or rent on taxes.

As someone who used to work in recruiting, a business riddled with corporate overlords sucking the blood out of their employees for little more than basic administration, Iâ€™m quite used to explaining to people that their current bosses arenâ€™t treating them right and that they deserve more.

Which they do, since theyâ€™re the ones actually doing the work. So while we never stop talking about automation replacing labor, how about automation replacing my once bloated recruiting department and the bosses skimming the margins off the top?

**Work Quest** is a company cut in the mold of traditional business killers like **Fiverr** and **Upwork.** By bringing freelancing to your fingertips, these companies have put developed countries to be on track to have **more freelancers than full-time workers** ***in potentially less than ten years.***

And while of course those massive international companies in Fiverr and Upwork are dominating the market, itâ€™s not hard to imagine how utilizing the trustless ledger of the blockchain will become essential as we scale their operations up, with both companies and freelancers looking toward the platforms that take the least of their money.

Now check this out, search for some competitors.  **Argon, which is at a $55M circulating cap, is out there, but theyâ€™re on BSC**. For Ethereum, no oneâ€™s really stepped up. Ethlance got a lot of attention but then disappeared. Bounty0x is still alive at a $2M cap, but just hasnâ€™t found a way to get any traction in its four years of existence.

You could try to blame the market but when Argon is clearly picking up so much speed and MATIC is available to handle gas fee concerns, the onus falls on the dev and marketing teams.

And thatâ€™s where Work Quest separates itself. **Their public team and advisors are loaded with experience both in DeFi and traditional finance** and this is certainly not their first business or project. The presentation on the website is top-notch cemented by this [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii2e9lu2KuI).

If you had any doubt that Work Quest is for real, that should be right out the window by now. Beyond a steady hand at the wheel, theyâ€™re already forward thinking, developing expansions to their platform such as **P2P insurance and a retirement savings plan**. These are ingenious solutions to the potential fallout of a freelancer-based society and shows how quickly this team can get attention and gain traction.

But really, no one does a better job of presenting themselves than Work Quest, a company that understands how to grow this business and take advantage of a market looking for answers after theyâ€™ve been working from home for so long. Just scroll down their [frontpage](https://workquest.co/), and make sure you catch the partners and road map at the end, itâ€™s quite impressive.

So how early are you on this one? Well, they released the token for public saleâ€¦ **today**. Like just now. So yeah, if you wanna cash in on this token that **just listed at a sub $1M cap**, Iâ€™d probably just go pick some up right now. Link below:

**Research PDF with working links - (**[**https://docdro.id/FiFC6Ac**](https://docdro.id/FiFC6Ac)**)**

**Description:**

EncrypGen is a decentralised genomic data marketplace, or in layman terms, a self-sovereign platform for the purchase and sale of genetic data for scientific research purposes. If you ever had a DNA test done (e.g. [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com), 23andme) chances are you were given the chance to sell your genetic data, these companies often sell this data to pharmaceutical firms for around **$140 per individual**. EncrypGen gives back control over your data and lets you profit from participation in genetic research. Pharmaceutical companies **need to purchase $DNA tokens** through the EncrypGen platform to use individualâ€™s data for research, and **you profit** from their purchase.

Currently, EncrypGen's database contains around **1,500 individual genetic profiles and brings around $300k revenue per year** according to their SEC filings ([https://sec.report/Document/0001780439-20-000057/](https://sec.report/Document/0001780439-20-000057/)). The company has recently partnered with African startup IndyGeneUS (relationship to Africa CDC/Microsoft) which will bring a whopping extra **19,000 genetic profile** to the database. Furthermore, a bond offering raised another $200,000 for the company which they estimate will allow them to acquire another **10,000 genetic profiles**.

The bigger the database, the more desirable it becomes to research companies, but to keep it conservative, **the acquired datasets would translate to a revenue of about $5.8 million!**

With a **fixed/scarce supply of 71 million $DNA tokens** (already fully distributed!) and tokenomics which directly correlate company revenue to token price (i.e. companies need to buy $DNA to access database), that would mean a possible **19300% token price increase, putting it at $1.25 by the end of the year minimum!**

And even then, EncrypGen would still be an extremely low cap ($83m) compared to its less technologically advanced competitors such as 23andMe (valued at $3.5b), this is **SOOOOOO EARLY!**

**Relationships/Partnerships:**

EncrypGen has direct and indirect connections to:

* ConSensys (creators of Metamask, co-founder of Ethereum) - **EncrypGen's CEO Dr Koepsell is an advisor to ConSensys Health!**
* ConSensys Health recently joined DTRA with board members including AstraZeneca, Microsoft/Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Pfizer, Oracle, IBM Watson Health
* **Recognised by the World Economic Forum!**
* One of the only platforms fully compliant with the new data protection regulations on genetic data!
* **Market Cap $4 million** whilst competitorâ€™s (23andMe) were recently valued at **$3.5 billion**
* Genetic data market moves around **$600 million in transactions every year**, and it's only getting more popular
* **Huge database deal with IndyGeneUS for Q3 2021 (bringing 19,000 datasets to their database)**

 **Why is it the right time:**

* 23andMe announced going public, and due to its genetic database of 10 million users it is valued at $3.5 billion. (\[Fears over DNA privacy as 23andMe plans to go public in deal with Richard Branson | Data protection | The Guardian\]([https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/09/23andme-dna-privacy-richard-branson-genetics](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/09/23andme-dna-privacy-richard-branson-genetics)) )

You'll never be fully informed if you only read news confirming your bias. Whether your bias is negative or positive.

-You hold ADA and think it's the next ethereum? Read this https://twitter.com/CardanoBits/status/1378829738291171328

A small NFT sale on ada caused light wallets to not sync. Network couldn't handle it. Might not be a problem, but you have to read against your bias.

-You think tron is a shitcoin scam that no one uses? If you read a bit you'll see that most of stablecoins transactions between exchanges are done via the tron network, why? because right now transferring USDT using ethereum will cost you $20 in fees. Using tron will cost you 0$ in fees. You see how there would be a genuine demand for tron no?

-You love Saylor and think he's the crypto messiah? Watch this: https://twitter.com/insiliconot/status/1378207883960139776

He says ""BTC moves at the speed of light and can do a million tx per second""

Maybe he's just like any other salesman who just jumps at the latest train to make a quick (billion)buck and has no idea about the tech. Actually in 2013 he said Bitcoin will go to zero.

t3_mku5b6,"**The Charts**

Youâ€™re probably as familiar with $BOG now as you are with UniRockets traffic lights of joy/pain! Today BogTools and bogged.finance just announced theyâ€™re in partnership with not just UniRocket but also WaterfallBot! Bog Charts will now be the sole provider of chart links on all UniRocket BSC trade posts! So yes the rocket emoji in this post has a legit use this time, blame UniRocket!

**LIMIT ORDERS**

Itâ€™s worth mentioning again that on Friday they also released the groundbreaking Limit Buys for all BNB-[token] pairs! Limit orders for selling is coming in about a week, and stop losses coming soon after. This is one of you last early warning calls! While people are distracted by finding the next shitcoin moonshot you can have the pleasure of showing them a new coin with actual real-use tech with as much room for growth as any other project. Theyâ€™re only a month old and undersold due to everyone being consumed by meme hype! Expect people to flood here when the bubble bursts and when the BNB pump has settled down. Everyone will need somewhere to invest their moonshot gains, and this is it!

**Where to Use These Tools!**

So you can find these damn sexy charts on [charts.bogged.finance](http://charts.bogged.finance), just paste in the contract address for whatever coin youâ€™re watching. This is a perfect tool to share with you telegram groups and your obsessive watching, so donâ€™t forget to bookmark!

The limit orders can be found on [bogged.finance/trade](https://bogged.finance/trade), again youâ€™re gonna want to bookmark this because itâ€™s going to step up your game more than any other tech this year. Get a good nightâ€™s sleep and donâ€™t miss those dips! 

**Not enough for you? Theyâ€™ve still got all this:**

It wouldnâ€™t be fair to not include the other magic this project has while Iâ€™m here.
Thereâ€™s also the RNG oracles which is expected to get a lot of attention from other new token projects for things such as giveaways, airdrops, games, NFTs etc.


While weâ€™re on the subject of games and NFTs you should know BogTools and bogged.finance have stepped up the game *again* with their ARG (augmented reality game) with a prize pool of $5000 in tokens! This is a mix of real life and tech problem solving, itâ€™s an immense maze of rabbit holes, clues, leads and puzzles.

t3_mkncb2,"$LOTTO was a contestant for Moonshot Monday two weeks ago and has since seen lots of progress and growth. Notably, in the past two weeks $LOTTO has:

* **Been listed on WhiteBIT**
* **Announced it is forking to BSC within days with a 1:1 fork for current ETH holders, meaning all ETH holders at the time of the fork will get an equivalent amount of BSC LOTTO for free. Eligible wallets who have not yet claimed the airdrop on the ETH chain will be eligible to claim on the BSC chain.**
* **Been featured on Alt Coin Buzz, a 250k subscriber youtube channel** ([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGyqEtcGQQtXyUwvcy7Gmyg/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGyqEtcGQQtXyUwvcy7Gmyg/videos))

This is a legitimate project with fully doxxed developers who have been working on the project for over nine months, before the current bull market. The fast WhiteBIT listing is a testament to its legitmacy. It was developed on the ETH blockchain and will be forking to BSC in days. This is not another pancakeswap pump and dump, it is a real project with real staying power! **And the market cap is still only around $5-6 million!**

**LOTTO** is a massive, decentralized lottery between everyone with LOTTO tokens in their wallet. Via a unique rebase function, LOTTO deducts $1 worth of tokens from every LOTTO holder and randomly awards the deducted tokens to one lucky wallet, the â€œjackpotâ€ winner. This is done without any gas fees! Simply hold LOTTO and youâ€™ve got a ticket. It is a borderless lottery that canâ€™t be controlled or stopped by anyone, even the LOTTO team. The lotteries this week awarded jackpots worth over $5000 worth of LOTTO to the winning wallets. This entire process is open source and uses Provable to verify randomness. Anyone can verify the randomness of the contest by plugging any winning transaction into Provable here: [https://app.provable.xyz/home/check\_query](https://app.provable.xyz/home/check_query). You can find winning transactions on the LOTTO website below.

Imagine how inefficient lotteries across the world are today. LOTTO has the potential to consolidate the entire idea of a lottery onto the blockchain, cutting out governments and needless corporations from the pie. No longer will a piece of every lottery ticket go to a plethora of government and corporate entities, leaving a reduced share for the person who wins. 100% of the pot goes to the players, every time.

With an active community, an attractive airdrop program &amp; an active development team â€“ its drastically undervalued at its current valuation. As the jackpots increase in size, the incentive to become a part of the LOTTO community increases. This coin has the potential to be a household name in crypto, and at around a $5,500,000 market cap, it is at a very early stage.

Available on Whitebit, Uniswap, Hotbit, and Bilaxy (and soon pancakeswap after the BSC fork)

t3_mkdj1l,$PANTHER - Brand New Animal Charity Coin! Less than a week old.,uniswap,1
t3_mkdj1l,"$PANTHER is worth your attention. Mega upside potential with a project of this caliber this EARLY!

**Market Cap: $320K**

Similar to the infamous animal coins popping up and exploding exponentially due to their amazing communities, I think this has potential to be another one. At this market cap, coupled with the fact this project is less than a week old,  there is ridiculous opportunity here! 

Similar tokenomics to Hoge, however 0.1% of every transaction is donated **AUTOMATICALLY to a PUBLIC ETH walle**t to save endangered wildlife! Amazing sentiment. This ETH wallet belongs to the Aspinall Foundation, which was founded in 1984. This globally recognized charity has 120K YouTube subscribers and 50k combined Instagram/twitter followers.

At it's peak, HOGE had a $500million market cap. This means if we can achieve 10% of this, you are looking at roughly a **160x** from the current position! At 1% of Hoge peak it's still a ridiculous 16x! Definitely worth grabbing a bag at these levels IMO.

  
**About the foundation:**

Aspinall Foundation Website:  
[https://www.aspinallfoundation.org/](https://www.aspinallfoundation.org/)  


The Aspinall Foundation's founder, John Aspinall, dreamed of reintroducing gorillas bred at Howletts and Port Lympne back to the wild almost as soon as he started collecting and breeding them in the early 1970s.

Today, this dream is being carried forward by his son, and current chairman of The Aspinall Foundation, Damian Aspinall. We believe that the reintroduction of animals into their natural habitats can help conserve wildlife and their environment.

Over the past few years alone, we have bred, nurtured and released hundreds of animals from our animal parks back to the wild where they belong. From our wild animal parks in Kent and other collections in Europe plus working in situ in Congo, Gabon and Java we have released 8 black rhino, 135 primates, 11 European bison, and over 70 western lowland gorillas back to the wild.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tokenomics**

1% of every transaction is burned, reducing the supply over time.

1% of every transaction is redistributed to every holder.

0.1% of every transaction is sent to the Aspinall Foundation, a charity trying to halt the extinction of endangered species.

Available on UNISWAP and expect a number of CEX listings within Q2 2021. CMC and Gecko listing coming shortly.

t3_mkn4zx,"After cruising the posts here, and following various telegram groups, I have come to the conclusion that many people in DeFi are trading blind, and it's crazy. **If you are trading anything in DeFi, YOU NEED TO BE USING A CHARTING TOOL.**

I have done a deepdive into the following platforms, and I will tell you briefly about them, and why I believe [Chartex.pro](https://Chartex.pro) and it's native token $CHART is the most undervalued of the space:

**What tokens/platforms exist?**

[Chartex.pro](https://Chartex.pro) Market Cap $9.1M        Holders: 5125

[Dextools.io](https://Dextools.io)  Market Cap $71.9M      Holders: 4826

[Astrotools.io](https://Astrotools.io)  Market Cap $4.6M     Holders: 1572

[Moontools.io](https://Moontools.io)  Market Cap $4.9M     Holders: 728

[UniDexbeta.app](https://UniDexbeta.app) Market Cap $4.3M Holders: 833

[cryptokek.com](https://cryptokek.com)  Market Cap $5M     Holders:  614

[apetools.gg](https://apetools.gg) Market Cap $1.7M        Holders: 2215

[bogged.finance](https://bogged.finance) Market Cap 19.8M  Holders: 8526

Damn, 8 different ones...! OK, this space is starting to get crowded, the market will have to pick some winners soon. The stakes are quite high. These sorts of tools are getting more and more valuable every day. Total market cap of crypto is now over 2 trillion dollars.

After the last bull-run, [Coinmarketcap.com](https://Coinmarketcap.com) itself was [acquired by Binance for over $400M](https://decrypt.co/24031/binance-to-acquire-coinmarketcap-in-400-million-deal). That was when total Crypto assets were valued at 1/25th of what they are now.

So, one of these guys is going to be a billion dollar company. There will be consolidation and one will become the **Bloomberg of Defi and Crypto**

**Businesses already making money**

As it stands, **Dextools** was first with the largest adoption. However they have yet to add BSC charts, however they have a powerful platform and pay dividends to holders of over 100k $DEXT. Right now, those dividends are averaging about $2000 a month in passive income for holders. Dext has the best wallet identification and tracking of the bunch.

**UniDex** is also paying dividends, and it is not just to the top holders, it is to ALL holders, and the profit sharing is paid in BNB. The lead dev and project manager stands behind his work, and has often been called ""the hardest working guy in DeFi"". Krunal Amin is active and pushes development 7 days a week. The first payout for holder was last month.

**Bogged finance and Apetools specialize in (and exist on) BSC right now**. Bogged has amazingly ramped up operations allowing for limit orders and all kinds of special features. Apetools is lagging and the Marketcap shows. Both tokens have burns on all token transactions. Which is attractive for degen plays, but complicates things for serious investors. (APE's $NANA has a 1% tax and Bogged's $BOG has a 4.5% tax)

**Astrotools** and **Moontools** have long been the uniswap tracking underdogs, but both have recently added BSC support and Moontools even has support for xDai's Honeyswap. Both have lagged in marketcap but now are catching up.

As for [**Chartex.pro**](https://Chartex.pro), these guys are the leaders in design, and were first movers on BSC support using their Metamorphosis Platform. It is a case of you get what you pay for. Chartex has by far the fastest tracking of movements, tracks all tokens, and allows you to see individual wallet movements both on Ethereum and BSC. To get full access to Chartex, you need to hold 5000 $CHART tokens, but for serious traders, it's worth it. Chartex is soon releasing a monthly fee based system, and loads of new features: [https://chartex.pro/?symbol=UNISWAP%3ACHART.95E63E&amp;interval=60&amp;theme=Dark#/tiers](https://chartex.pro/?symbol=UNISWAP%3ACHART.95E63E&amp;interval=60&amp;theme=Dark#/tiers)

**Where is this headed?**

I believe that we will see a few of these reach 1 billion dollar MCs at people make bets on where financial information will be coming from in the future. My general take is that all people speculating on DeFi should be holding at least a few of these project tokens.

**Based on current number of holders/users of each token compared to current marketcap, where do I think you should put your money?**

1. [Chartex.pro](https://Chartex.pro) 10-20 x near-term at the next coming breakout and as v2/metamorphosis news comes
2. [Dextools.io](https://Dexttools.io) 5 x possibilities as investors digest the reality of the large platform dividends
3. [Unidexbeta.app](https://Unidexbeta.app) 10-20x near-term as word about profit sharing spreads
4. A Basket of the others. I would say bogged, but the current MC seems high for where we are (but not for where we are going). High risk/high reward is [apetools.gg](https://apetools.gg), market cap is tiny and simple attempts to catch it's peers could result in quick 10x pushes.

My research goes much deeper than this, but I will leave it here for an initial post. I will add more later to try and help you track who the leaders are in in this space.

TLDR:

Buy $CHART, use it's platform and sleep soundly. Buy a full basket of Tokens the the space if you want to build generational wealth. It's not going away.

t1_gtft6ab,"To all the (potential) TRX newcomers:

In December of 2017 and January 2018, TRX was a new coin still on the ethereum blockchain (ERC20 token).  It had a young CEO behind by the name of Justin Sun.  Love him or hate him, Justin Sun is a huge promoter of TRX - big surprise.  At some point, the shit eating (literally) John McAfee was promoting [TRX](https://mobile.twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/945658681580048384?lang=en) among many other coins, and they were being pumped and dumped hard.

Some of these coins were â€œgoodâ€ and some were â€œbadâ€ but that really didnâ€™t matter if they were getting pumped, people were FOMOing in like crazy.  In early January 2018, TRX hit its all time high of somewhere around .30 USD.  

Some people bought TRX at or around this price, and itâ€™s never really gotten anywhere back close to this price.  If you buy something high and then stare at it for hours/days/weeks/months/years and watch it lose money, you start to hate it. The low price and some Justin Sun promotional fumbles have created a group for f cryptocurrency enthusiasts that truly hate TRX, Justin Sun and anyone else affiliated with the project. 

Flash forward to present date and TRX is a completely different coin(for the better) with options to stake, liquidity pools, airdrops, smart contracts, wallets, BitTorrent and much more.  Itâ€™s on its own blockchain with other coins built on it and even though proposal 51 was passed and fees went up x3.5, its now on its way to become a deflationary currency. 

So read OPâ€™s post and read mine and then go out and DYOR. Then come back and tell me if you think TRX is still here back in the top 20 (as of recently) because of unworthy hype and promotions or because itâ€™s grown from an obscure ERC20 token to the Tron ecosystem you see before you.",ethereum,1

First the token will be released in Binance Smart Chain, so load your BNB ready. You can swap GULAG in PancakeSwap after launch.
Second wave will be taking over Ethereum Chain. After second phase is done, you can swap GULAG in Uniswap.
Dev planned the launch today, time and contract details will be announced. Stay tuned in the Telegram Chat.

My personal view: Yes, this project is new, and still a lot of unknowns. But I have the impression this dev is very serious, and when community grows this token is a good one to keep. The 1 day restricted selling is unique in Bsc-world and every wallet holder joins the daily lottery automatically. When people like this, they will stay at the project. Also no presale is a sign that the project is here to stay. But again, there are a lot of unknowns and the true motives of the project devs are also unknown. What's also unknown is how the community will grow and what the market will do. Those are the risks, but that's the price you pay; for being one of the very first and in regards of the unknowns described earlier. But off course DYOR.

**Now, tomorrow 6th of April, 5 PM UTC** they are going to list their own token on Uniswap at 5 PM, right after IDO launched through Poolz Launchpad.

**Purpose of GAINS token?** By holding GAINS token, you can join private sale groups and get exclusive deals to invest in future top-tier crypto projects in early phase with price lower than listing price on an exchange. This is a token with real utility.

Uniswap listing will be at price of $0.05 per token with market cap of $200k. **The demand for this token is going to be very high tomorrow, so I'm hoping to get in below $1.**

# Overview

Chow Chow Finance (CHOW) is a low cap RFI fork meme coin that first launched as an erc20 token in early February. Like many other redistribution tokens, all transactions are charged a fee (3% in this case), which is redistributed to all holders in proportion to their holdings. Early on, the community put together a wallet of 1 million CHOW tokens (they donated them out of their own pockets). This wallet is now known as the charity wallet; those 1 million tokens (1% of the total supply) are never touched, but the interest they generate via transaction fees is periodically donated to charity. The first donation ($2,232.48 USD) was made to Operation Kindess ([https://twitter.com/OpKindness](https://twitter.com/OpKindness)) in mid-March. CHOW is currently in the middle of the second charity drive, which will be ending towards the end of April, and for which it is partnered with Morris Animal Refuge ([https://twitter.com/MorrisAnimal](https://twitter.com/MorrisAnimal)).

CHOW is a community-driven project. The community is wholesome. The team is made up of volunteers from the community who bought their CHOW on the market like everybody else. In short, CHOW is a meme coin with a heart. A wholesomecoin.

# Tokenomics

First of all, it's important to note that, as of 8 days ago, a second CHOW token was launched under the same contract, but as a bep20 token on BSC, as a way to expose CHOW to a new market space and give people a way to gain exposure to the project without paying exorbitant gas fees. These tokens are not bridged, and so they are independent. However, as, they have the same contract, they have the same tokenomics. I'll write more on this below, as it can be confusing.

CHOW has a circulating supply of 100 million. It is neither inflationary nor deflationary: tokens are neither minted nor burned. 

As mentioned above, every buy, sell, or transfer is charged a 3% fee, which is redistributed to all wallet addresses that hold CHOW, in proportion to their holdings. It is important to note that exchanges are excluded from this, so CHOW isn't being redistributed to exchange addresses and liquidity pools, only real holders.

**Both tokens have 100% liquidity lock**:

At the time of writing, the erc20 token has a market cap of 1.16 million, with 943 holders, and the new bep20 token has a market cap of 374 thousand, with 426 holders, with the average wallet therefore holding $1,120 worth of CHOW.

**Both tokens have been audited by Solidity:** [https://solidity.finance/audits/CHOW/](https://solidity.finance/audits/CHOW/)

# Charity

Both tokens have their own charity wallet holding 1 million tokens, which accrue interest from transactions fees. At the end of each charity drive period, the tokens accrued by these wallets are sold back to the market, and the proceeds are donated to the charity that the community selected for that drive. At that point, a partner for the next charity drive is selected.

The first charity drive ended in mid-March, and over $2200 was donated to Operation Kindness. The current drive has been underway for nearly 3 weeks, and is expected to end near the end of April, at which point all charity wallet profits from the current period will be donated to Morris Animal Refuge. The owner of Morris Animal Refuge is reportedly planning a live event to receive the donation in-person from a CHOW representative, who will be flying out to Philadelphia for that purpose. The refuge has apparently successfully held such events before, which double as opportunities for attendees from all over the state to adopt their animals.

The third charity drive partner will be decided after the conclusion of the second charity drive.

# The Team

Chow is a community-driven project, and the team is thus made up of volunteers from the community. There are no dev wallets; any CHOW holdings that team members have were purchased on the open market like anybody else. The early volunteers donated their own CHOW to build up the charity wallet that now accrues interest for charities. Many of the team members have spent money out of their own pockets to fund the development of the project and build up a marketing campaign. The team members have consistently shown dedication to the project by not selling at any of the various ATHs that have occurred. The team of volunteers is highly engaged with the community; in fact, it is hard to say where the community ends and the team begins. Ideas and suggestions brought up by the community are regularly considered and adopted by the team.

# Partnerships

In addition to being partnered with Operation Kindness and Morris Animal Refuge for the charity drives, CHOW is partnered with The Gem Hunters (with whom they are co-hosting an NFT contest): [https://twitter.com/ChowChowF/status/1375555125108862977?s=20](https://twitter.com/ChowChowF/status/1375555125108862977?s=20)

CHOW also recently announced a partnership with BetsPodcast and BTCVIX (ie: Satoshi Street Bets): [https://twitter.com/ChowChowF/status/1378075819730378757?s=20](https://twitter.com/ChowChowF/status/1378075819730378757?s=20)

# Potential FUD

**Why are there two tokens with the same contract? Won't this just dilute the original erc20 CHOW holders?**

The team has generally responded to these sorts of questions with the following points: volume on the ETH chain was being heavily suppressed by gas fees, so the introduction of the BSC token opens up the general CHOW project to small investors who can't afford gas while we wait for Uniswap 3 and Ethereum gas solutions. Many traders trade exclusively on ETH or on BSC, so this way they can all get in. Both tokens contribute to the same charities, so in the end, it all goes to the same place. 

The team believes that opening up to the BSC market will increase exposure to the overall CHOW project, which will help both tokens. They have pointed to $FEG as an example of a project that launched parallel tokens on these two chains, which seems to have led to an eventual price convergence, and an overall massive boost to both tokens and the project as a whole.

**How do we know we won't get rugged?**

Rug pulls are everywhere nowadays, and we've all got to tread carefully. After following this project for the last month, I have become pretty convinced there is no rug in store. First of all, note that the liquidity pools are 100% locked. Also, there are no developer or team wallets. 

Of course, the volunteers that make up the team have personal wallets, and some of them have substantial holdings. Like with all projects, there is technically nothing guaranteeing that they don't sell at some point and cause the price to tumble. However, it is worth noting that their wallets are watched by the community, and they have not sold at previous opportunities when CHOW has hit ATHs. Regardless of the ebb and flow of CHOW prices, the team has simply continued to consistently work on growing the project. 

The most convincing point for me, though, is that the team of volunteers has paid for CHOW's growth and marketing entirely out of their own pockets, and have volunteered countless hours of their own time to the project. It would be counterintuitive for them to rug the very project they have being pouring their own time and money into. 

**Isn't CHOW merely yet another charity redistribution meme coin?**

Well, the simplest answer is CHOW was the first. In the weeks after it launched in early February, clones and spinoffs with nearly identical tokenomics began popping up, literally by the dozen. Some of those have done well, and are still standing. Others were pumped and dumped and abandoned; still others were rugged before even making it off the ground. One of the most major of these projects not only copied the CHOW idea, but created a near clone of CHOW's website. After going through a meteoric rise, this project crumbled into obscurity.

Of course, being first doesn't make anything best. But CHOW has proven that it has staying power. It has weathered all the crests and troughs of its price waves without the team selling out or slowing development. In the tortoise and the hare parable, CHOW is the tortoise,  It has not yet seen a meteoric rise like many of its peers; this might seem like a negative, but all it really means is that it still has great potential upside. The project has continued to grow, irrespective of market sentiment. In the short term, markets are mostly noise. In the long term, however, prices always converge on project quality. Therefore, so long as the teams maintains the steady, consistent project growth that we have been seeing, I feel very comfortable holding this asset through its low market cap early days.

# TLDR

CHOW is the original charity redistribution coin. It raises money through transactions fees and then donates those funds to charity. It is a community-driven project based on a wholesome community. It is a meme coin with a heart. In short, I like the coin.

X42 just launched a system that is scarily similar to a decentralized bitpay.

Recently a small microcap called X42 Protocol launched a two-tier system of client and server, one of these servers offers a system that is essentially a fully decentralized bitpay on their blockchain, and it allows all users to take part in the profits generated.

Some basics about X42:

\- Proof of Stake coin with a max cap of 42 million.

\- Fee-lees and extremely fast

\- Two-tier system of their clients

a. xCore â€“ their client service software, a wallet with extra functions

b. xServer â€“ their decentralized server nodes that allows for several systems to function

Here is what really caught my attention though: one of their servers allows for what they call â€˜price locksâ€™ which are essentially a fiat to crypto instant pairing system, they lock the price of their coin to one of several fiat pairs and transact with a â€˜PIDâ€™ (payment ID) within that period.

They claim this system can be implemented into any payment service or website, and it seems to be the case, since they just launched and it is working on their main network, the fee for this service is only 1%, way less than bitpay or any credit card company takes. This fee goes directly to the server owner that processes the transaction.

Doesnâ€™t take much for one to imagine what they can do if X42 implements some sort of dex on their system that allows crypto to crypto pairings, fiat looks to be just the beginning.

To host this system the users are required to create a profile on their network that costs 5 usd in their coin and 50k x42 to be locked up in cold staking, they can be withdrawn immediately if the user wants. Apparently, these profiles can also be used as domains in their network too, so maybe we will see decentralized web pages on x42.

Right now each X42 costs just $0.12 cents, so that totals just over $6k plus the profile registration. Their network seems to use these PIDs for payments, so there is movement. As far as I know there isnâ€™t a system like bitpay implemented powered by a decentralized blockchain anywhere else.

Iâ€™ve been lurking on their discord for the last few months and their support is very active, a lot of engagement for such a small project on their main social networks.

Their core development team mentioned that this system is scalable so you can throw lots on top of it, including credit cards or transfers if the user plugs it in their website and holds a bit of X42 to transact in their PID network.

As far as I know, and they claim, this is a world first for such a system to be so tightly integrated into their wallet.

Right now they are listed on smaller exchanges like stex, graviex and a few others, so it is under the radar for most crypto investors. Theyâ€™ve also got an ERC20 wrapped token (wx42) version of their coin, and are on uniswap.

The volume of the coin and its ERC20 token varies a lot, but there seem to be an engaged community behind it, and the developers have been delivering their milestones one after another.

I think this one is way undervalued! This can be a game changer for crypto.",uniswap,1
t3_mkoo7k,"If you don't know who I am, I'm a blockchain enthusiast and Bitcoin investor since 2010/2011 who happens to love this subreddit. I've given you a few microcap gems already, like; [BiFrost - $BFC](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/lw9a4b/my_1st_post_post_here_my_100x_token/) when it was around $0.05 and more recently this post about [PhoenixDAO - $PHNX](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/miqo8o/this_microcap_gem_is_about_to_blow_up_is/) when it was around $0.08. 

**I'm here to let you know about another massively undervalued microcap project that has already been posted on this subreddit, (I actually started my research into it after seeing it here).** 

However, I don't think the previous post here got enough attention, (at least not compared to some of the shitcoins often posted here), but since I have quite a few followers I'm hoping this post will give the attention to this project that it deserves. 

Let me know in the comments what you think? ðŸ¤·â€â™‚â€ 

The microcap gem that I'm talking about is **Open Governence Token (OpenDAO - $OPEN) which is a *massively undervalued microcap* project currently sitting at a measly $8 million market cap** with a token price of only around $2.25 at the moment! 

**In my opinion this project is going to explode in value to at least $100 million market cap in the coming days/weeks, and probably $700 - $800 million minimum in the coming 12-18 months*, assuming they manage to deliver what they're promising.** 

**It's one of those rare microcaps that are getting harder and harder to find in this bull market, and that's about to explode in price.** 

$OPEN is project with a solid product that has *incredible value potential* and an experienced fully doxed team, and ***with several VC firms that have already scrutinised the project and invested their own money in the first seed rounds.*** 

Ok, so what is the Open DAO project, what are they doing, and why is it so undervalued? 

**In the first Phase Open DAO - $OPEN is building a system to collateralize all types of online tokens/coins that are currently not possible to use as a security for loans.** 

So what does that mean? 

It means that if you for example hold some *Raven coin*, *DigiByte* or *Swissborg* or any other of the thousands of cryptocurrencies and tokens available on Coinmarketcap, you will soon be able to use these coins as collateral to borrow USD, (stablecoins) at a low yearly interest rate (I believe around 2% or 3%). 

So let's say that you're in crypto for the long haul, (not just to make some quick fiat gains) and you have some tokens you don't want to sell. 

However, at the same time you'd like to free up some cash to buy a new car... 

**With $OPEN you'll now be able to use those strange and wonderful tokens or coins you own as collateral for a USD loan.** 

As you probably know you can already do this with BTC, ETH, BAT and a few other cryptos that have massive marketcaps on places like MakerDAO, Compound and others, *but no one else offers you the ability to use virtually ANY tokens/coins as collateral for loans*. 

**If this got you a bit excited about the potential of $OPEN you'll need to sit down, because we're only just getting started...** ðŸ™‚ 

What I've described above is only **Phase 1** of the *Open Governence Token* project, and that Phase has already started to launch just recently. 

**Phase 2, Phase 3 and Phase 4 are going to blow you away!** 

In Phase 2 you'll be able to use almost ANY listed stocks you own as collateral if you want to borrow money. 

Do you own 100 or 1000 shares in Tesla, Facebook or Apple for example? 

Ok, you can just lock them up as security in what OpenDAO calls a ***""Cashbox""*** and then use your stocks as collateral to borrow money, (see this videos to understand how the ""cashbox"" system works: https://vimeo.com/478731239 ). 

All without the hassle of dealing with a bank demanding: 

***""pLeAsE pRoViDe YoUr InCoMe StAtEmEnTs FoR tHe LaSt 3 YeArS aNd ShOw Us hOw YoU sPeNd YoUr MoNeY oVeR tHe LaSt 6 MoNtHs, So We cAn MaKe SuRe YoU kNoW hOw To KeEp A bUdGeT.""*** 

**If you go through all this hassle then *MAYBE* we will *CONSIDER* lending you some money, IF your credit score and our other arbitrary demands meet our lending criteria. Oh and yeah that will be at 8.5% interest rate since you don't have any collateral!""** 

***""But Ma'm I DO have collateral. Look, I have all these stocks in my Robinhood account, and my expensive car that's parked right outside!""*** 

***""yEaH bUt We DoN't AcCePt ThOsE sOrT oF tHiNgS aS cOlLaTeRaL aNd 2 yEaRs AgO yOu WeRe 2 WeEkS lAtE oN a PaRkInG tIcKeT.""*** 

Most of us are done with banks and their horrible and predatory practices, for these and many other reasons! ðŸ™„ 

**With OpenDAO and DeFi we don't really need the banks anymore!** ðŸ™‚ 

Let's move on... 

**In Phase 3 you'll be able to use gold, silver, your car, you camper van, your summer cabin or maybe even your valuable collectable guitar or almost any other small asset you own as collateral for a loan.** 

And finally... 

**In Phase 4 you'll be able to use land, commercial real estate and other large assets as collateral, making banks almost completely irrelevant.** 

Are you starting to see how big this is going to be yet? ðŸ™‚ 

**Here we have a startup crypto project that was launched last year, with a competent team and a project that has been scrutinised by several prominent blockchain Venture Capital Firms who have invested in it (because they know they are going to 100x their investment or more), sitting at *only $8 million* market cap!** 

It's almost unbelievable, and the only explanation is that they're busy building and haven't done any marketing yet, and the VC firms (that normally help with marketing) haven't done much so far, but all that's about to change! 

**According to the team a marketing campaign is planned for the near future. Apparently multiple top crypto and financial publications as well as well-known YouTubers will soon start writing/talking about $OPEN. Theyâ€™re also in talks to get listed on multiple big exchanges.** 

Once this happnes, (could be within days, or maybe weeks, I don't know, but it's about to happen), the floodgates will open and the big investors will pick up on this project, which is *virtually unknown* now except for the VC firms that have already invested... 

**This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor, just like the VC firms, and ride the 10x to 100x wave that's *virtually guaranteed* in the coming days/weeks/months (it's always hard to time excatly WHEN something will explode).** ðŸ™‚ 

Let me expand a bit about the VC firms btw. 

***""What's all this about VC firms, and why is it a big deal?""*** 

It's important because *OpenDAO (Open Governence Token) has gone through the extensive scrutiny* that comes with raising money from Venture Capital firms. These companies don't just throw millions in seed round funding to projects that they haven't scrutinized and analyzed. 

They do their research before investing. 

**Here Are Some Of The Venture Capital Firms That Have Invested In OpenDAO - $OPEN** 

**Moonwhale** 

These are the guys that discovered and were seed fund investors in projects like ***Avalanche***, ***SuperRare*** and ***Celsius***. 

**Signum Capital** 

This is a Singapore based Venture Capital firm that funded projects like ***Kyber Network*** and ***Zilliqa***. 

**X21 Ventures** 

These guys put in $2 million in the first seed round for ***PAID Network*** for example. 

But you may still be asking: 

*""Why is it so beneficial for me that these VC firms have already invested in Open DAO - $OPEN?""* 

**Here is my take:** 

It's really difficult for ordinary people like you and me to evaluate projects with ambitious plans with a lot of technical aspects to them, like Open DAO has. Remember, they want to collateralize almost **all** onchain and offchain assets! 

It was the same when MakerDao first arrived on the scene. 

*""Is it possible to do what they're planning technically?""* 

*""Are they likely to succeed?""* 

**MakerDao now costs more than $2200 per token and is valued at more than $2.2 Billion, but it was hard to know when it launched if it would really work. I think Open Governence Token - $OPEN could be much more valuable if they succeed!** 

*""Why?""* 

Because the markets they are about to collateralize are so massive. 

**All Crypto:** $1.9 TRILLION

**Stocks:** $85 TRILLION

**Real Estate:** $250 - $300 TRILLION 

**Gold/Silver:** $10 - $11 TRILLION

That's hundreds of Trillions combined, and **$OPEN only needs to capture a tiny fraction of a percent of *any* of these lending markets to be worth Billions, and at the moment they are worth $8 Million!** 

So you do the math on what's about to happen to the token price once this projects gets out there. ðŸ™‚ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸ 

My point is that it's a lot easier to judge ***the idea*** of a project, (and I think we can all agree that this idea is amazing), than it is to judge the team's ability to execute on that idea, ***but this is where Venture Capital firms excel.*** 

They have specialists that evaluate the team members, not just to make sure they're legit, but also to make sure they have the required expertise to execute on their plans. 

They are also experts at evaluating whether the project plans are achievable or not. 

In the case of $OPEN several of the heavy hitter VC firms have decided that; *""Yes their plans are indeed possible.""* and that's why several prominent VC firms have invested in them. That's important. 

Another good thing is that most VC firms don't just offer funds and then tell the team to; *""Go off and build your idea now"".* 

**They often also function like incubators.** They help projects get the right start, make sure they stay legal and help them deal with compliance and help them promote in mainstream media etc. once the projects are ready and go live. 

VC firms want the maximum return on the projects they invest in, it's as simple as that. ðŸ¤·â€â™‚â€ 

**Anyway, this post got a bit longer than I had planned, but I hope you now understand why a $8 million market cap, (or even $40 million if it was that!) makes OpenDAO MASSIVELY undervalued, and at some point soon it will explode in value.**

t3_mkuctu,"In the past year many people, including myself, realized the potential of working remote jobs from home. Lots of people work on websites like Fiverr, Freelancer, and Upwork, but we lack of a decentralized recruitment platform. That's where Work Quest comes into play.

What they're trying to solve:

Mercurity Fintech Holding, Inc. (Nasdaq: MFH) announced it's the first public company to announce plans to launch an open, decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that will be designed to solve retail traders' global problems of low liquidity and capital utilization, poor governance, token growth incentive deficiencies, and slow transaction speeds. The Company's mission is to build a global, unified, and diverse decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem by connecting the world's best DEXs, centralized exchanges (CEXs), and DeFi communities across the globe.

Today's DEX liquidity pool communities lack sufficient autonomous governance to fully take advantage of their potential value. Many DEXs distribute transaction fees based on liquidity providers' actual contributions, but they neglect the value of liquidity pool creators, early-stage liquidity contributors, and non-financing community members, such as community managers, marketers, and other industry influencers. Such DEXs lack important incentives for non-financing contributors. In contrast, the Mercurity Open DeFi Platform plans to empower each liquidity pool with a high level of autonomous governance and growth incentives, including its own general partner and governance capabilities such as setting transaction fees, pool access requirements, trading rules, and voting rights. The Mercurity Open DeFi Platform will be designed to allow each liquidity pool in a DEX to become a programmable fund where anyone can create and operate their own fund.

&amp;#x200B;

**Roadmap:**

Product launches:

Q2 - Insurance

Q3 - Q4 - Loan agreements

QX? - Synthetics. They haven't given an exact date on this one, other than that it is being worked on

Confirmed in the past week that's coming soon (Q2?):

1. UI remake (new design)
2. Mobile-friendly user site
3. BSC related stuff (more info in the AMA)

9 Days old (Not a rug pull confirmed)
Audit - Completed by Techrate.org (document can be seen in telegram or on Techrate website)
Cmc and CoinGecko - Waiting to be listed
Community and marketing team is driven! 
Blockfolio listed!
First giveaway 10th April! Price will rise then I believe!
Consolidation after initial 1000% happened between 4000-5000 in last week, platform now ready to launch off of  

I have previously promoted: Doge (before it 300% to 0.05), posted about Hoge on day 1 (before if 1000x), $CHONK when it was $75 (now at $300+). Please remember that past performance doesnâ€™t not guarantee future results and always DYOR. You can check my previous post to see if Iâ€™m telling the truth. 

Super early on this.

$PEECH was released 9 days ago, is on the etherum network, and is only currently available on uniswap. They have said whitebit listing and others will follow. This is so early they have applied for cmc and CoinGecko and will be on there soon. Liquidity is locked for 12 months and the link is below to check it on the web. Audit completed yesterday and passed with flying colours!

You only need one $PEECH to enter lottery!!! Costing 0.0000003 cent or so for a Chance of winning $5000+! Better odds than national lottery.

$PEECH is a fresh innovative new crypto that interacts with its holders and the community via live stream video burning and giveaway show. Every week the owner, who is doxxed and not hiding his identity, will host a show where he will use a randomiser to choose between 0.01-5%. What ever percentage is chosen he will then burn or giveaway, depending on what category he is doing. He will also use the randomiser to choose how many winners there will be, and who will win it.

No transaction tax, no need to raise slippage 1% is fine. All the burn and redistribution is done through lottery system. So maybe one or a many lucky winners gets a huge sum of $PEECH (could be over $5000). I think this adds a fun and innovative way to burn and redistribute, might not be great for every investor but the ones they win could easily 100x there stack and I want a ticket for that. Itâ€™s a good one to buy a small bag, be in the lottery and let the price build up whilst you have a chance of 100x from lotto or by price....maybe both ðŸ¤”

The owner is honest, 9 days in and no massive sell pressure from him or his developers is a huge plus sign (people that have 1000% selling small bags). I met the owner online and is a stand up guy. The 12 months locked liquidity is a show of intent and longevity of it. He has thrown everything in to this and I trust he will make it a success. 

Price is stabilising at the moment but is still plenty of time to get on before the first live stream on April 10th and have a chance to win 10 billion $PEECH (worth thousands! And you only need to hold one PEECH)

The community believe in $PEECH, including myself, and wonâ€™t stop preaching the $PEECH till we are satisfied everyone has heard of us. Investing is your choice, our job is to make it that you know we exist ðŸ™‹â€â™‚ï¸

t3_mkl1y4,"Meliora ($MORA) is a cross-chain swap platform; a DEX (with order book) that will allow swaps across chains (Ethereum, Cosmos, BSC, DOT, AVAX etc). This is right on point for the cross-chain stage we're entering into, and the hype around projects that can deliver cross-chain tech will be massive.

Atomic swaps are the gold standard of cross-chain transactions, and Meliora's proposed solution looks promising. The combination of AMM-style always-on incentivized liquidity with an order book and cross-chain capability is a legit gamechanger.

For tech overview start here: [https://meliorafinance.medium.com/the-blockchain-industry-which-began-with-bitcoin-is-basically-a-component-of-the-financial-d487a2a1efda](https://meliorafinance.medium.com/the-blockchain-industry-which-began-with-bitcoin-is-basically-a-component-of-the-financial-d487a2a1efda)

The MORA token can be staked (50-90% staking APY depending on the amount of MORA held), offer Revenue Sharing of all the protocol's transaction fees (requires 5k+ MORA), provide governance, and offer trading fee discounts.

MORA currently sits at around 2-3m market cap, with 2.3m MORA tokens in circulation. 1m MORA tokens will be available as staking rewards during the next 5 months. (any unawarded $MORA will be burned forever - medium article link below).

The team is semi-anon. They KYCed to their investor (Pinpoint Capital) and to Dextools. The code has also been audited by Solidity Finance, to give investors confidence in such a small, early project.

\*\*Further details\*\*

Meliora did their presale at .45 , which hit hard cap (380 ETH) and sold out in under 2 minutes. They then launched at .50 and have been ranging between 1.00-2.00, with a momentary ath of 2.50. Right now its bouncing around support at $1.10, give or take a few cents. Thats only around 2x listing and only 3x presale.

Around 20% of the supply is currently locked up in staking, and that number is only going up. The liquidity pool depth on uni is around 400k, which is close to nothing. Weâ€™re currently just under 1,000 holders but this is continuing to grow everyday. There is a small, active community on Twitter and on the Telegram group, so at the moment its still under the radar. The team has not started any real marketing yet - just a quick AMA on Gem Hunters.

These conditions are overall extremely bullish in my opinion. The moment this thing gets attention, it will shatter the $2.50 ath. And once it does start to move, the staking feature will be even more valuable. Even if you only scoop enough to earn the 50% staking tier, and it conservatively only goes 3x in the near term (which is VERY conservative, given the supply constraints and lack of attention) then you'll be getting around 80 MORA/month for staking, which would be valued at approx $240, potentially. Hard to beat on a microcap.

Good luck everybody! DYOR

tl;dr a new wallet application that runs off the MORA token, the wallet will offer cross-chain atomic swaps in a service that aims to exceed what Uniswap, Pancakeswap etc can offer

If I swap this in uniswap will it show up in metamask?",uniswap,1
t3_ml3sbp,"More and more projects are currently being built around the theme of DeFi, and this coupled with the Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) is leading to an increase in the volume of transactions on ETH blockchain, thus congesting the network. Inadvertently, the cost of sending tokens from one ETH wallet to another is costing more than $10, and so is making a trade on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. As of the writing of this article, a simple trade on Uniswap needed $60 in gas fees in order to execute within a reasonable time frame. Although this might be manageable by the institutions and whales who perform large transactions, it is definitely not friendly to the layman. Just think about this â€“ Would your mom or dad spend $60 in gas fees alone to purchase 0.25 ETH worth of $ERN tokens on Uniswap? This comes to about 13.33% transaction cost, let alone the consequences of â€˜price impactâ€™ on Uniswap.

Now the question becomes â€“Â  Are there better alternatives available for our parents and the general public to purchase the popular DeFi tokens without shelling out these exorbitant transaction costs? Yes! There are solutions in the market that allow the users to use Layer-2 solutions and the DEXs built on top of them to make transactions at lower prices, but these processes involve multiple steps like sending tokens between Layer-1 and Layer-2, and these are not at all friendly to the layman..

On the other hand exchanges like Mandala Exchange, backed by Binance Cloud allows its users to make transactions at very low fees, while providing thick order-book liquidity. Mandala Exchange actually shares its liquidity with Binance, and this means that the orderbook at Binance is the same as Mandala. With the SAFU insurance and state of the art wallet security, the customers of Mandala Exchange can trade without the fear of losing their funds. Additionally, the wallet architecture at Binance and Mandala is the same, thus making it very simple to transfer tokens or coins between them with no fees, and take advantage of the staking options available at Binance. Binance exchange offers various staking options to its users without the hassle of dealing with transaction fees on the ETH network.

In addition to the above mentioned benefits of using Mandala Exchange, there are many DeFi projects already listed and trading on Mandala. Creating an account on Mandala allows you to trade these DeFi tokens at substantially lower fees. For comparison, Uniswap charges 0.3% as trading fees, and this is in addition to the ETH GASÂ  fees and price volatility due to â€œprice impactâ€. Moreover, there are multiple order types currently available on Mandala that allows the users to trade tokens at their desired prices. This is not yet feasible on Uniswap. To sweeten the deal further, users can lock their $MDX tokens on Mandala to unlock discounted trading fees. These advantages at Mandala enable the users to trade DeFi cheaper than on Uniswap or any of the same.

Over the last month or two, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has emerged as a strong contender to ETHâ€™s dominance in the DeFi space. With near zero fees and near instant transaction time, many projects on ETH are migrating or integrating with the BSC chain to avoid the exorbitant costs associated with ETH network. Mandala Exchange plans to list the tokens available on the BSC chain, thus making these tokens accessible to its users (at a much lower cost), with the ability to transfer with zero fees to Binance in order to stake and earn.Â 

So with all this in mind, if you hold a small bag of $MDX here is the math:

.05% Trading Fees with 320k $MDX @ $0.14 = $44,800

.05% Trading Fees with 9,000 $BNB @ $373 = $3.3M

You could potentially save big time on trading DeFi on Mandala and then transfer to Binance for free to stake. An interesting way around the insane gas fees in the market right now...",uniswap,1
t3_mkxfo7,"NII has been on my radar for a while and recently started getting INSANE traction on Uniswap. Nahmii is a Layer-2 scaling protocol for the Ethereum blockchain.

You guys can google Nahmii to read about the project; I'll tell you why I think it's a moonshot even after 10Xing in the past few days.

NII is still under 1000 holders, yet has $5,000,000 liquidity and $6,000,000 24 hour volume on Uniswap. The official telegram was locked a month ago by the team in preparation for a series of big announcements. The only reason I can think of for them to do this would be to prevent any leaks getting out about massive partnerships with serious organizations. Further, look at the Uniswap activity- the people buying this token today are mostly whales. Buys of $25k+ are the norm for this token right now. Seems like the smart money is flocking to NII, and something HUGE is imminent.

I can only speculate, but the above has me thinking that the Nahmii team may have came up with an L2 solution that is actually revolutionary for the ETH blockchain, and will be supported officially by some huge names. The only rumors I could find on telegram point to Microsoft and the Ethereum Foundation itself.

DYOR as always.

t3_mkm5cb,"So I donâ€™t know about the rest of you, but this past year Iâ€™ve watched a ton of my friends flip into work from home forever jobs. And while they might have to run out to a meeting once in a while in person, theyâ€™ve realized most of their job doesnâ€™t require an office to be done. Some of them have also realized, if youâ€™re self-employed, depending on where you are, you may be able to write off your mortgage or rent on taxes.

As someone who used to work in recruiting, a business riddled with corporate overlords sucking the blood out of their employees for little more than basic administration, Iâ€™m quite used to explaining to people that their current bosses arenâ€™t treating them right and that they deserve more.

Which they do, since theyâ€™re the ones actually doing the work. So while we never stop talking about automation replacing labor, how about automation replacing my once bloated recruiting department and the bosses skimming the margins off the top?

**Work Quest** is a company cut in the mold of traditional business killers like **Fiverr** and **Upwork.** By bringing freelancing to your fingertips, these companies have put developed countries to be on track to have **more freelancers than full-time workers** ***in potentially less than ten years.***

And while of course those massive international companies in Fiverr and Upwork are dominating the market, itâ€™s not hard to imagine how utilizing the trustless ledger of the blockchain will become essential as we scale their operations up, with both companies and freelancers looking toward the platforms that take the least of their money.

Now check this out, search for some competitors.  **Argon, which is at a $55M circulating cap, is out there, but theyâ€™re on BSC**. For Ethereum, no oneâ€™s really stepped up. Ethlance got a lot of attention but then disappeared. Bounty0x is still alive at a $2M cap, but just hasnâ€™t found a way to get any traction in its four years of existence.

You could try to blame the market but when Argon is clearly picking up so much speed and MATIC is available to handle gas fee concerns, the onus falls on the dev and marketing teams.

And thatâ€™s where Work Quest separates itself. **Their public team and advisors are loaded with experience both in DeFi and traditional finance** and this is certainly not their first business or project. The presentation on the website is top-notch cemented by this [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii2e9lu2KuI).

If you had any doubt that Work Quest is for real, that should be right out the window by now. Beyond a steady hand at the wheel, theyâ€™re already forward thinking, developing expansions to their platform such as **P2P insurance and a retirement savings plan**. These are ingenious solutions to the potential fallout of a freelancer-based society and shows how quickly this team can get attention and gain traction.

But really, no one does a better job of presenting themselves than Work Quest, a company that understands how to grow this business and take advantage of a market looking for answers after theyâ€™ve been working from home for so long. Just scroll down their [frontpage](https://workquest.co/), and make sure you catch the partners and road map at the end, itâ€™s quite impressive.

So how early are you on this one? Well, they released the token for public saleâ€¦ **today**. Like just now. So yeah, if you wanna cash in on this token that **just listed at a sub $1M cap**, Iâ€™d probably just go pick some up right now. Link below:

They have a program (basically like an academic scholarship for funding) that acts as an incubation tank for the community. Instead of having 30 Devs funding themselves, Catalyst basically puts you on the Cardano payroll to create a project (like a research grant you don't need to pay back). It is an ingenious way to bring ingenuity to your company, and who knows what talent it will bring in.

There is not one project in this space with this kind of think-tank community driven research happening. Not just moon boys and speculation, Phds applying for grants to build sustainable ecosystems. It includes, a blockchain based, community driven voting system that elects how money is transferred to new projects as well.

If you think ADA doesn't have a future in this space, then you mine as well stick a fork in crypto as a whole. It is hands down the most meticulously documented, fundamental based, forward moving crypto out there.

Imagine believing that ETH will always remain #2? Or any asset or company will remain at the top forever. The Tech sector has the most changeover in terms of rank and utility in comparison to other markets. In 10 years time only 20% of the world population will be using gas for their vehicles. The point is, other systems will come along.

Nobody wants to recognize the elephant in the room. The ETH devs bit off more than they could chew in 2021, and half of the year uniswap and ETH gas fees/transaction speeds have made it almost unusable. It has become a wonky store of value.

t3_mkfnok,"There's been a lot of drama in the meme-coin space lately, for this reason that I wanted to propose for a drama-free token that has retraced lately and not enough love and credit: Sad Cat Token ($SCAT).

It listed on Coinmarketcap last week, which is huge. It went 10x last week on Coingecko listing, but retraced hard since.

$SCAT is a UK based project, and the dev team has worked hard to build trust within its adopters. Liquidity is locked for 6 months, and the team wallet is locked as well. Not that it matters, but as far as I know $SCAT was the first to make charity-work its core utility.

$SCAT is simple:

Every week the $SCAT community votes on a small cat rescue to help and sends them the USD- equivalent of 9,999,999 $SCAT. $SCAT's donation amount is directly tied to the value of $SCAT. So, the higher $SCAT goes, the higher the donations are. Everything is transparent and verifiable, as rescue operations are chosen and funded through gogetfunding. The Sad Cat community has already donated $400 to a cat shelter in Romania, $500 to one in Gaza, $300 to one in Indonesia and $250 to one in Cyprus. Next donation poll is this Saturday.

Sad Cat Token already went parabolic last week hitting a spectacular 7X from 700k to ~5m market cap (~$2,500 donation amount!!), but has since corrected back to $700k market cap. After all the recent fud with other meme-coins, $SCAT still has a strong community behind it!

t3_mkp0q6,"Unbox.art is Degen Labs fork of Blindboxes.ioâ€™s solution that locks creative NFTs into â€œboxesâ€, the contents of which are randomly allocated, and allows these to be bought by collectors. Blindboxesâ€™ token, which they say will reward box buyers and be used for governance, reached nearly a billion dollar valuation shortly after launch.

Degen Labs will conjoin this opensource technology with the ability to create ERC20s from batches of NFTs to make creative NFT value fungible.

In summary, Unbox.artâ€™s tech achieves three things:

- Creates a new sales channel for creators and a new market for collectors;
- Makes the NFTs tradable as ERC20 tokens;
- Creates a new revenue stream for curators of boxes

Unbox.artâ€™s token $UBA is similar to Blindboxesâ€™ $BLES (rewards and governance) except for two demand-side additions in our design that leverage our Liquid Vault innovation:

- Part of NFT sale royalties will be swapped for $UBA on its Uniswap market creating regular buy pressure. This $UBA will capitalize the Liquid Vault.
- $UBA will be required as payment to mint NFTs on Unbox.art. This $UBA will capitalise the Liquid Vault.

If you can, for instance, dca 500 every month into Eth, and you have a 10 month horizon, put 5000 on Eth now and leave those monthly 500 on your savings account to cover your principal. Could be a way to hedge against the risk and buy a sizeable chunk of Eth before its bull run.

t1_gtgdlyu,"Bitcoin aside for a second (as michael saylor has talked enough about how he thinks it solves the gold portability problem, by upgrading an analog rock into a digital asset) the price of digital assets of programmable blockchains (ie blockchains that can or will be able to compute smart contracts, such as ethereum, binance smart chain, cardano, solana, algo, tezos, eos, avalanche, fantom, harmony, others) make it such that these platforms are inherently competitive in nature. The holders of each platform's tokens want it to succeed, so there is a strong innate incentive to increase transactions per second, confidence in the platform itself, governance functionality, complexity of the transactions that can take place, etc.

Google any big-4 accounting firm's report on the prospects of smart contracts towards completing a range of complex transactions, eg (1) securitization of ABS, (2) secondary markets issuance and trading, (3) insurance involving countries with weak or unreliable legal systems to reliably effectuate insurance contracts, (4) identity record keeping and de-identification as they relate to crowd-funding and other transactions where some amount of each party's identity, whether commercial or personal, needs verification, (5) NFT's being tied to all kinds of different property title to aid in the transfer of said titles, either as part of a smart-contract will or complex transaction. The value of blockchain itself in the future will almost certainly outperform the value of bitcoin (its utility value as well as monetary value, unless you say that bitcoin is valuable because it led to programmable blockchains), as the value of blockchain will likely rise all the oceans on which our digital lives take place, thus rising all boats.

Any reputable programable blockchain today is a  ""shared computer,"" (or what Coindesk calls a ""global computer"" in its top-20 analysis) which allows for (1) verifiability (for those who can or need to verify), (2) immutability (cannot make edits to the record without a majority (or for some chains 33% plus of the network's power), and without those edits being recorded), (3) efficiency (arguably low right now tbh but set to increase based on the competitive environment of programmable blockchains fueled by each platforms digital asset price), and (4) transparency (similar to verifiability, but in that you can see things in real time and it's possible to develop software on top of these blockchains that conveniently communicate what's going on, (5) redundancy, where a blockchain is replicated in a decentralized or distributed way so that it's practically impossible to erase  the chain of events, and (6) governance, where agents of the blockchain are economically incentivized to alter the performance of the blockchain as needed in response to changing circumstances, to prevent obsolescence.. eg quantum computing is invented and upgrades are needed to increase encryption. In terms of bitcoin, it's possible to increase the 21 million limit higher for all I know.. so yeah, this sixth point is where things might get messy for platforms that don't have as much restrictions on governance, or where governance is decided by people who have a small minority of the economic value of digital assets on the platform, ie made by a centralized agent with a negligible economic interest in the platform.

I think the fifth factor (5) redundancy, as I imagine ten-twenty years down the road, you'll have a competing web of public programmable blockchains interopping with one another (ie no Binance smart chain unless Binance offers insurance on all transactions completed on their chain, or there's accessible and effective third-party insurance), and if one chain goes down, things will slide onto a secondary chain that will replace the primary chain until its fixed.

Yes, correct that is literally what it is.  Perhaps you are aware of this but it's a hard fork of bitcoin, not just a software copy.  It was an attempt to control some aspects of bitcoin and its mining by some dishonest actors including Roger Ver and Jihan Wu.  They wanted it to be the ""real"" bitcoin.  That's why they took over the r/btc subreddit.

Now it's mainly just a coin used for cheap transactions.  If you're happy with that, that's perfectly fine.  But you can accomplish that with literally any copy/paste of bitcoin's code.

&amp;#x200B;

In what seems to be a ritual by now, XMR lags behind the pack. Whether it's regulation or something else, XMR's price has lagged behind in every metric, from Bitcoin to alts. Still better than fiat though!

&amp;#x200B;

**9 - XRP - $148.34**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Signs of a heartbeat.](https://preview.redd.it/voy6hr75scr61.png?width=790&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90eda9b7b957e601593e5b94163793841d3c4886)

Still lagging behind the pack, it looks like the former #2 of the Crypto world has begun to pick up a bit of its slack. Time will tell if this is just following in Bitcoin's footsteps, or if the SEC trial continues to pull at its pricing.

&amp;#x200B;

**8 - ETH - $249.75**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Steady and solid, but largely moving with BTC.](https://preview.redd.it/flmcl8kiscr61.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b08f23306103d725a69100d184270ef8327f0026)

In a normal challenge, going 5x your original amount would be crazy and cause for celebration. However, in terms of this one, ETH is actually lagging behind the rest of altcoins. Still, a $2000+ celebration is in order for all the ETH holders, which is a major price milestone. High gas fees continue into 2021 however, so maybe people are skeptical about scaling issues and the time it will take to resolve them.

&amp;#x200B;

**7 - IOTA - $360.19**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

IOTA seems to have picked up signs of life in the last month, rocketing to two new spikes that remind holders of the 2017 days. It's no all time high again (Yet), but surely this should give people enthusiastic about the project good vibes.

&amp;#x200B;

**6 - NANO - $371.12**

&amp;#x200B;

[A little issue with proof of work.](https://preview.redd.it/ae4kv4hctcr61.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac25cde34444b956b8a7d9ebdf2de6123883f563)

NANO looked to be rising to get near its former glory when a spam attack hit the network, bottlenecking transactions and halting exchange activity. Its price has regressed in the meantime. Still, an impressive run since November can't leave people interested in the project too sour, and an update was quickly pushed to mitigate damage, so maybe it will do better in next month's challenge.

&amp;#x200B;

**5 - VET - $483.76**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[An all time high once again.](https://preview.redd.it/afqk16o2ucr61.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=845c61b20c27e3b0f1ed294ade5c0319d4939f97)

&amp;#x200B;

VET has pierced the $0.10 mark, marking this as the first time since 2018 it has crested a new all time high. It enters price discovery mode now, so enthusiasts are excited to watch where it leads from here. 

&amp;#x200B;

**4 - LTO - $592.99**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Touched a new all time high, retracing since then.](https://preview.redd.it/5fgxfv3iucr61.png?width=779&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=872b2c618861059c36c5a0be5659720dbdfe68eb)

&amp;#x200B;

LTO has seemingly become a /r/cryptocurrency fan favourite since November, hitting all time highs seemingly every month. It seems to hit a new all time high every week, retracing gains since then, but still remains in the top 300. Is more to come for LTO or was this a flash in the pan?

&amp;#x200B;

**3 - ADA - $595.13**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Too close to the sun, Icarus.](https://preview.redd.it/ey86sz4wucr61.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3e2d80af7f4b0ea246f3e52cc13a4e06d5a3d1c)

&amp;#x200B;

ADA started the month with a rocket past $1, smashing all time highs, then hit another blistering milestone, climbing almost to $1.50. It's since regressed slightly as people take profits and consolidation happens, but ADA's prowess is more than noticeable since challenge start.

&amp;#x200B;

**2 - SOL - $635.74**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[If your chart looks like this, you're in good shape.](https://preview.redd.it/xsgm7q2rvcr61.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dec34cb4526dec70aeb3effde6eb06d2bb17689)

&amp;#x200B;

SOL has been a surprise performer, absolutely smashing not 1, not 2, but 4 all time highs in this month alone. In November, there was some FUD about the supply increasing and the market cap being bloated, but it's still remained a shooting star since then.

&amp;#x200B;

**1 - DOGE - $1137.88**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

DOGE continues to be the frontrunner, with spikes and dips based on Elon Musk's current sentiment and twitter posts. Still, DOGE is up so much from the start of this challenge it's looking questionable if any other coin will go anywhere near its heights.

Iâ€™m fine with ETH, BTC and a few other larger cap alt coins. Iâ€™m too old for this shit too haha.

Right now I'm trying to buy XLM to transfer BTC from ProBit to Binance and it's just pumping right in front of me. I started with the highest buy order at 800 sats and within 5 minutes I can't even buy for 860+ sats anymore.

t3_mksyhr,"Locked Liquidity for 12 Months
9 Days old (Not a rug pull confirmed)
Audit - Completed by Techrate.org (document can be seen in telegram or on Techrate website)
Cmc and CoinGecko - Waiting to be listed
Community and marketing team is driven! 
Blockfolio listed!
First giveaway 10th April! Price will rise then I believe!
Consolidation after initial 1000% happened between 4000-5000 in last week, platform now ready to launch off of  

I have previously promoted: Doge (before it 300% to 0.05), posted about Hoge on day 1 (before if 1000x), $CHONK when it was $75 (now at $300+). Please remember that past performance doesnâ€™t not guarantee future results and always DYOR. You can check my previous post to see if Iâ€™m telling the truth. 

Super early on this.

$PEECH was released 9 days ago, is on the etherum network, and is only currently available on uniswap. They have said whitebit listing and others will follow. This is so early they have applied for cmc and CoinGecko and will be on there soon. Liquidity is locked for 12 months and the link is below to check it on the web. Audit completed yesterday and passed with flying colours!

You only need one $PEECH to enter lottery!!! Costing 0.0000003 cent or so for a Chance of winning $5000+! Better odds than national lottery.

$PEECH is a fresh innovative new crypto that interacts with its holders and the community via live stream video burning and giveaway show. Every week the owner, who is doxxed and not hiding his identity, will host a show where he will use a randomiser to choose between 0.01-5%. What ever percentage is chosen he will then burn or giveaway, depending on what category he is doing. He will also use the randomiser to choose how many winners there will be, and who will win it.

No transaction tax, no need to raise slippage 1% is fine. All the burn and redistribution is done through lottery system. So maybe one or a many lucky winners gets a huge sum of $PEECH (could be over $5000). I think this adds a fun and innovative way to burn and redistribute, might not be great for every investor but the ones they win could easily 100x there stack and I want a ticket for that. Itâ€™s a good one to buy a small bag, be in the lottery and let the price build up whilst you have a chance of 100x from lotto or by price....maybe both ðŸ¤”

The owner is honest, 9 days in and no massive sell pressure from him or his developers is a huge plus sign (people that have 1000% selling small bags). I met the owner online and is a stand up guy. The 12 months locked liquidity is a show of intent and longevity of it. He has thrown everything in to this and I trust he will make it a success. 

Price is stabilising at the moment but is still plenty of time to get on before the first live stream on April 10th and have a chance to win 10 billion $PEECH (worth thousands! And you only need to hold one PEECH)

The community believe in $PEECH, including myself, and wonâ€™t stop preaching the $PEECH till we are satisfied everyone has heard of us. Investing is your choice, our job is to make it that you know we exist ðŸ™‹â€â™‚ï¸

Firstly, it is just common decency to do the best do educate newcomers. This goes for everything in life.

People who have been here since when the sub was created (OG's) know the sub has gone through waves of evolution. From the high quality early days, to the month long Doge hype (remember that?!) which then gradually evolved into discussion about other big cap coins (like BTT) and now we have how the sub is in it's current state, leaning more and more towards speculative lower cap coins. And the sub will keep evolving, especially with some of the changes that will be coming in the weeks ahead.

The mod team is aware there has been a steep rise in people using this sub to peddle their latest shitcoin - hence why we created r/SatoshiStreetDegens. At the moment, any coin submission which is less than 3 days old is removed from here by the mod team and directed to that sub... it's a lot of work even for 10 of us. We're looking to expand that process to include other objective rules, for example a listing on either CMC or CoinGecko. But beyond that is where it gets tricky and opens up a can of worms of us deciding a coin to be ""worthy"".

At the end of the day, we could moderate this sub so strictly and introduce so many rules it becomes a clone of r/CryptoCurrency but then what's the point? There is a bunch of things being worked on behind the scenes but the priority right now is getting SatoshiSwap out of the gate. As always, we're open to constructive, actionable feedback which can be objectively applied.",doge,1
