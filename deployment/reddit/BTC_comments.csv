milonuttigrain,"&gt; Bitcoin’s fixed supply has led some fans to consider it akin to “digital gold” – in reference to the yellow metal, another beloved inflation-resistant asset. So-called stores of value assets stand the test of time because they are uncorrelated with other assets and are resistant to entities that interfere with the market. But are cryptocurrencies like bitcoin really a hedge against inflation?

Outside of using a L2 like Lightning Network, Bitcoin is really slow on average if the mempool is congested (sometimes it can take 1-2 hours+ to get 6 confirmations when sending over L1).

\* Limited to only 7 people's settled transactions per second
  

  
\* Meaning that even Lighting users could only settle their insecure IOUs once per lifetime if everyone on Earth used Lightning
  

  
\* With those closure fees on L1 rising exponentially if it tried to run at even 5 or 6tps with only doubled adoption usage
  

  
\* Lightning being insecure because you need to watch your Channel at least once a fortnight or risk losing money to a forced closure
  

  
\* And which is descending into a hub and spoke network because its dynamic path finding problem is insoluble
  

  
\* And which has closure fees
  

  
\* And is unreliable even for $5 coffee payments, with car-sized payments being totally impossible
  

  
\* And which is complex to use non custodially
  

  
\* So has fewer public nodes than it had a year ago
  

  
\* The main Bitcoin chain still getting less usage at 3tps than it had 5 years ago
  

  
\* The electricity of Greece required for ⅓rd of a second for each of those 3tps settlements
  

  
\* Resulting in enormous fossil fuel CO2 emissions
  

  
\* Yet still taking 39m 59s longer to secure than superior cryptocurrencies
  

  
And now the killer fault. The showstopper:
  

  
\* It costs $6.5b to operate its security annually. That comes from inflationary rewards to miners. And that inflation is being inexorably removed. Those rewards are currently an average $65/tx fee subsidy. But when they're gone, fees won't be ""just"" be $65. because fewer people will be able to afford that. So it's more likely to be 325/tx at 0.6tps. Then $650/tx at 0.3tps. With $1000/tx needed to get a first-block confirmation. Then it collapses into instability.

Particular_Relief154,"I’d been wanting to get into crypto since I read about Bitcoin hitting £7000, back in like 2017.. Never really knew how to go about it and dismissed it as something only techy people would be able to do..

Fast forward to 2019 and in a new job when I hear one of my colleagues friends has made £90k on cardano, and he uses this particular app.
Now I thought, I can understand how to use an app (in my head I previously convinced myself that I’d have to do coding and hardware investment etc to jump on board). But the app stayed on my phone for a few months and I only got round to signing up spring 2020- by this point Bitcoin has gone up somewhat, so I’m thinking invest in smaller coins to the odds of £20 here and there..
Turned my profits 5x and invested in a meme coin That further tripled these profits. I was thinking I’m the king of reading markets. The app put a withdrawal limit on the meme coin, the price dropped and I lost 95% of my value..

So now I’m worse off than when I started. But it’s okay, I learned a lot about Bitcoin and crypto. Only regret is I didn’t invest earlier than I did, or into Bitcoin earlier.

For anyone not long got into it- even if you’re up- really recommend learning everything there is to know about Bitcoin and crypto, and why it’s around and what it aims to achieve.

(sadly, not DavinciJ15 back in the day) I liked the idea behind Bitcoin but didn't like that it wasn't physical so stuck with silver. A few years later Bitcoin was back in the news and I couldn't figure out why there was so much hype, so gave it another look. Learned about the fixed supply, somewhat decentralized nature, and heard some folks like Andreas Antonopoulos explain it in ways that made a lot more sense, so jumped in at the end of 2017. Got burned pretty hard but it made sense to me and I stuck around.

The main thing that keeps me here is my hope that humanity will develop a financial system out of the hands of governments and banks etc. I've come to see inflation as pure immoral theft, and think we desperately need a better alternative. It's unlikely we'll go back to a gold/silver standard, and perhaps crypto's won't be it either, but for now, it appears to be the best alternative out there.

The government cannot take it in traditional ways. They are forced to play nicely if they don't have a way to access it (they could torture you too, technically). Point being, it's much simpler to secure digital assets than physical. Period. I COULD keep the recovery phrase in my head, if needed. I wouldn't bank on that method, but now it's possible. 

Idk, man. It definitely feels like this is an opportunity for a big break. I hate so many things about the current system I just want out. I'm not saying BTC is the dream future, I'm saying publicly controlled money is a step up from the current corrupt douche canoes that hold the key to the vault behind closed doors that we see today. They can devalue money when it works in THEIR interest. I, for one, dislike that. Fuck em.",1661669970,im3n8ke,CryptoCurrency,2022-08-28 6:59:30,2

I was going through a script-kiddie hacktivist phase, so I just found it cool and nerdy, the whole blockchain concept and cryptography as a means of exchange. I lost that wallet completely, would've been really rich last year 🤷‍♀️

Then came back in Q1 2021 because of memes. Literally Doge. Not for money, not for the tech. Just because Doge.
Then got heavily into technical analysis, which correlated well with my job, and started doing it as a hobby. Just for fun. I don't have much money, so I was basically posting graphs on discord servers, making people happy and slightly richer, while I wasn't making those trades myself. It was a way to live through others. Some people play video games, I was charting. It was something I could do in my work PC while working remote (I didn't own a PC back then) and had fun with it.

Then I got more into fundamental analysis and ended up getting drawn back to the tech side, 10 years later after the first contact. While I do like the idea of investment (who doesn't like money?), that isn't my main objective nor my goal (and some of my bigger bags show it, as they are mostly to support projects I like and believe, regardless of price actions).

I almost quit crypto when the Luna/UST debacle happened. My few profits and some money for future buys, I had in UST because I was weary of Tether (ironic, eh?).

I was also thinking about getting into stocks, maybe silver and gold ETFs because I wanted to be able to buy and sell with much more ease. Then I started reading about Cyprus and how banks were taking depositors money. The people started to use this thing called bitcoin to avoid banks. So I started to read everything I could on bitcoin. It was exactly what I was looking for, the scarcity of metals with the ability to buy and sell it like an ETF. I then watched the price 24/7 watched it bounce from $75 to $250 then crash to $50. Then I knew it was time to buy, but by the time I set up a MTGox account and transferred money from Dwolla it was already back to $120. I bought and bought and bought all averaging around $110. Then I learned about altcoin in the spring of 2013, the money was insane. I used BTCe and Cryptsy, everything was new and everything pumped as soon as it hit the market. It was all copy and paste coins, the dumbest shit you could imagine. There were Bottle Caps, BBQ coin, and even Frankos. If we are currently in the Wild West then 2013 was the stone age.

Wright's word, and the word of a bunch of other witnesses he brought up who testified he talked to them about Bitcoin long before the white paper was published. Because if there's anything a person concerned about staying anonymous would do, it's talk freely with people who know him personally about the project he needed anonymity for.

Wright claims he deliberately destroyed his ability to provide cryptographic evidence because he wants to prove, in court, that cryptographic evidence doesn't matter.  He wants to show that traditional forms of evidence, witness testimony and legal argument, are more important than Bitcoin cryptography.  He claims he *allowed* people to call him a fraud, *so that* he could sue them in court, *so that* he could prove his identity using traditional forms of evidence and show that Bitcoin is bound by the legal system.

Because if there's anything the Bitcoin white paper is known for, it's the argument that relying on trusted third parties is better than trustless cryptographic systems, and the assertion that sound money must be subject to law and government regulation.

Wright, from his own testimony, wants to set a precedent that Bitcoin is subject to laws and government regulation, and then with that precedent claim ownership of Bitcoin and, with the help of various governments' judicial systems, take direct control of the software.

Rxef3RxeX92QCNZ,"&gt; Mining pools offer a buffer against such network attacks as the hash rate is distributed across thousands of individual miners.

This depends on how the mining pool is setup and is NOT the case in most mining pools. They provide jobs to the individual miners, ie. they control the work that those individual miners are doing. A malicious mining operator or one who was hacked or coerced is absolutely a 51% attack risk

&gt;The memory hardened aspect of ergo also makes this vector of attack more expensive as there is no ASIC support to rent. With the collective rentable rigs at the moment this isnt a viable path to a 51% attack. In theory, someone could build a massive GPU farm to try to launch such an attack. If a bad actor can rent a warehouse of ASIC and mine on a small chain with 51% attacks are a viable option... if there is an offramp. 

Right now it's about $13,000 to 51% attack ERGO. There is not enough available for rent, but we just saw the biggest drop in demand for GPU mining in history so there's bound to be a lot more miners available soon https://www.crypto51.app/

&gt; The current exchange situation doesn't provide the liquidity for a viable offramp

I’m not upset, we’re having a conversation. The default thinking is always the way things are currently done because you don’t know any other way. Just because it’s the way things are now doesn’t mean it’s obvious any other way won’t work or even work better. There’s no reason it can’t happen slowly over time. You don’t need a dollar collapse to slowly have bitcoin gain value against the dollar. Or put another way, the dollar is designed by policy to lose 2% a year of purchasing power. Today it’s losing much more than that. If bitcoin just stayed constant relative to say wheat or corn or anything tangible, it would still gain value against the dollar due to the dollar losing value by design.

If you run this out, people will hoard the thing that’s valuable and spend the thing that’s not. But eventually the dollar becomes worth less and less until I just don’t want to accept it for my goods and services. People could offer discounts to pay with the better currency.

Focusing on carbon intensity means focusing on the supply side and not the demand side (i.e oil production vs. solar instead of drying machines and crypto mining). Should also add that there is even potential for crypto mining to be used as a tool to decrease net carbon intensity.

But BTC is a good place to start, eh? The main BTC client is available at https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/ . 

If you start a new node from scratch, it will ask the peer to peer network for Block #1, (which it may get from muktiple sources), then cryptographically verify it. Then it wil ask for Block 2, which depends on Block 1. And so on. The current block height as of this writing is 771120. So spinning up a new node from scratch will involve steady bandwidth until your node catches up (which can take days) and then sustained bandwidth in both directions to monitor new transactions (but possibly less then when you were syncing).

So the % increase (or decrease) is the same? Does it then really matter how much of a coin I own? Or is it only the amount I've invested?

If in both examples the value of a bitcoin goes up 100%, it doesnt matter if you own 0.01 bitcoins or 10 bitcoins, does it?

efadd,"People are free to use the Bitcoin network as they choose, that is the beauty of soft forks. Why do you care what address format someone uses? Not everyone needs to be the on the cutting edge of the latest and greatest utilities. I remember posts like this bemoaning the slow adoption of SegWit as well, and that has slowly but surely increased.

People will upgrade when it makes sense for them to do so. Personally I always want to be lagging behind because I want new updates to be out in the wild for awhile before I trust them with any significant amount of money. Let the tinkerers toy with it a bit, maybe even break it. I'm okay with someone else being the guinea pig.

To make a comparison, the first mass produced electric vehicle was released in 1996 (GM EV1) and as of 2022 only 6% of new car sales were EVs. That doesn't mean that EV development was wasted, or that people not driving EVs are doing something wrong... just that voluntary adoption of new technology will happen over time as people determine for themselves when and how adopting that new technology makes sense for them.",1671626286,j13lf6z,CryptoCurrency,2022-12-21 12:38:06,1

sylsau,"Solidus Labs, a risk-monitoring company, has published an annual report on the cryptocurrency market.

The result: a high number of fraudulent cryptos. This is something that won’t surprise you if you follow this universe a bit.

Since its inception, Solidus Labs has never recorded as many fraudulent tokens as it did in this year 2022. From January to November 2022, over 118,000 fraudulent tokens were deployed. This adds up to 350 fraudulent tokens created every day, according to the Solidus Labs report.

The first is that Bitcoin is a separate species. If you want to take care of your money in a sustainable way, Bitcoin is where you should go. And if you do, remember to strictly enforce the motto “Not your Keys, Not your Bitcoin.” This will encourage you to take care of your Bitcoin yourself by storing it in a hardware wallet.

If you don’t do this, you will be letting a third party have control over your money. Probably not what you want…

The second warning is that the cryptocurrency world does indeed need stricter regulation to help users who still want to invest in this universe to protect themselves … Many initiatives are moving in this direction whether in America or Europe. This is a topic that will have to be followed carefully in 2023, hoping that regulators understand that there is a complete distinction to be made between Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.",1671621890,j13ever,CryptoCurrency,2022-12-21 11:24:50,1

The worst of the 2008 crisis, the max unemployment came in 2010, can you guess when the stock market bottomed? Early 2009, one year before. Why? Because the stock market is always AHEAD of the real economy and the max FUD happened in early 2009. The real economy right now is kinda ok, with low unemployment, good average wages, yet the stock market is 1 year into a bear market, when the real economy is actually fucked, the bottom will be in for the stock market and for bitcoin.

Chingron,"What I described has nothing to do with leverage.  

You create a token… it’s market cap grows to 1 billion units worth of American monopoly dollars.  You just created 1 billion of extra “value” in the world.  But actually, you didn’t because you can’t just redeem every token for the 1 billion without sending the price to zero.  If you were to do that, you just destroyed 1 billion of value… or… money… whatever you want to call it.  

The exact same could occur with actual dollars.  If every person and government decided to sell every dollar they have on the open market, the dollar would tank.  The dollars still exists… they didn’t disappear… but you just wiped away a lot of its value.  Instead of milk $5, it now costs $10

At the same time… money can and does actually disappear out of thin air.  Governments always create and destroy “money”.  Sometimes they print it, sometimes they burn it.  So… “money” absolutely is created and destroyed everyday.  

The amount of “value” on earth is continuously growing with inflation, discoveries of gold, inventions like bitcoin, etc… etc… And often, value is even destroyed when governments remove money from circulation.  And if the earth were destroyed by a meteor tomorrow, it’s value would go to zero.

Again… money, or value, does not follow the laws of physics.  It can be created and destroyed.  It can disappear and reappear.",1668306569,iw5fdtd,CryptoCurrency,2022-11-13 2:29:29,1

wtfeweguys,"I don’t understand what’s confusing here. The WWW isn’t the right start date to look at. The launch of bitcoin is much more similar to the launch of ARPAnet in ‘70. No smart contracts, no consumer-usable UI. It was for cypherpunks and librarians.

And still within a couple years there was a profitable use case - Silk Road. For the first time people were able to source illicit substances online with user reviews. But ofc that goes against the global regulatory regime so it was taken down.

It took about 6 more years for Ethereum to launch and we’ve been building interpreting protocols, experimenting with governance and tokenomics models, and refining user experiences ever since.

But since it’s all been happening in public with retail investor-level access it feels like a lot more time has passed bc more people didn’t know about ARPAnet. They only knew the World Wide Web, so it’s like the internet just popped into existence ready to serve them (geocities and aol).

Right now someone who bought at the peak of late 2017 would still be running at a loss. That’s a pretty hard pill to swallow for most.

People need to consider why they are in Bitcoin, and for how long they REALLY intend on sticking around.

The ones feeling the most pain are those who state they are “long term”, however were expecting to be filthy rich and cashed out by now.

If you want to play the game, realize that you may be stacking for many more years before the true benefits may arrive.

Depending on what your goals are, also consider investing in other asset types to give you something to work with, just in case Bitcoin doesn’t work out. Knowing you have a backup plan will also help you to sleep at night.

Elean0rZ,"As a general point, as others have said, it's usually not worth getting into it with skeptics.

Having said that, since this is your dad, you can probably afford to have more friendly arguments than you might want to with other people, and his specific point about Ponzi schemes is easily refuted, so you might choose to start there if you want. (Though in his defense there ARE crypto Ponzi schemes out there, just like there are Fiat Ponzi schemes--but the fact that some exist doesn't mean that all crypto is therefore inherently a Ponzi scheme.)

Anyway, there are 9 bazillion posts and comments out there about whether crypto is or isn't a Ponzi. I'd say the objective reasons why a reputable crypto project absolutely is NOT a Ponzi are nicely summarized [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sx5fij/comment/hxpzzdi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). 

As for topics of conversation with your dad, a starting point might be to ask this: If something like Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then what is gold? Gold is an asset that has been valuable for millennia basically because it's scarce and shiny. For literally thousands of years, it had no other use-case than the fact that it was scarce and shiny, and therefore people wanted it. More recently it's also developed some actual utility in the technological sphere, but that utility doesn't come close to justifying the price gold trades at. On the other side, Bitcoin's price is absolutely inflated by speculation also, but, just like gold, it also has some core utility, and people actually pay for that core utility: Bitcoin is really good at securely, trustlessly, quickly, and affordably sending wealth across borders, directly from one person to another, and people (not just sketchy people) do in fact do this every day.

As a more general point, blockchain is more than just cryptocurrency. This is before your time if you're 17 as you say, but one of the major paradigm shifts when the internet went mainstream was what we might call ""digital abundance"". The early music and file sharing platforms are a good example--you had a medium that used to be physical, like CDs or floppy discs or pieces of paper, and now suddenly you had the ability to make infinite copies and share them across the planet. Something that used to be constrained was now practically unlimited, which presented obvious problems from a copyright and business model perspective. In the years since the internet went mainstream, these issues have been partially addressed through laws and through new approaches to content-sharing (e.g., streaming services). But that process is ongoing and, fundamentally, what blockchain brings to the table is a path toward ""digital scarcity""--a way of proving authenticity (whether it's of a transaction or a concert ticket or a picture of a bored ape) that's quick, transparent, and doesn't rely on a central ""decider"". For sure it's still an emerging technology that's experiencing lots of growing pains, but I would argue that its core, technological value proposition is actually quite valuable.",1676583118,j8tmucs,CryptoCurrency,2023-02-16 21:31:58,2

HiCarumba,"&gt;According to the complaint, from September 2017 through January 2018, Vista falsely advertised that it would trade customers’ digital assets and earn a 2.5% daily return or “double in just 80 days.” The company said it would trade customers’ bitcoin and ether using “Robot Traders” that the CFTC said it never had access to, and instead engaged in a Ponzi scheme with new and old customer funds.

Now, if I saw 2.5% return or double your money in 80 days, I'd run a mile. Its a dead giveaway that it's a scam.",1676582151,j8tk7y0,CryptoCurrency,2023-02-16 21:15:51,1

HigreCrypto,"Defending cryptocurrency to someone who may be skeptical or not well-informed can be a challenge, but here are some key points to consider:

1. Decentralization: One of the key features of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is that they are decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by any government or financial institution. This gives individuals more control over their money and transactions, and can help protect against financial corruption or instability.

2. Security: Cryptocurrencies use advanced cryptographic techniques to secure transactions, making them highly resistant to fraud, hacking, and other forms of cyber attacks. While no system is completely foolproof, the security features of cryptocurrencies are generally considered to be very strong.

3. Transparency: Every transaction on the blockchain, the decentralized ledger that records all cryptocurrency transactions, is visible to anyone who wants to see it. This makes the system highly transparent and resistant to fraud or manipulation.

4. Efficiency: Cryptocurrency transactions can be completed quickly and at a low cost, compared to traditional financial transactions which may be slow and expensive. This can be especially important for people who need to send money across borders or make small transactions.

5. Innovation: Cryptocurrencies are a relatively new and innovative technology, and as such they are still evolving and developing. This means that there is a lot of potential for new applications and use cases, and that we are still learning about the full range of possibilities that this technology can offer.


Overall, while cryptocurrencies may have their challenges and drawbacks, they also offer a range of benefits and opportunities for individuals and businesses. By emphasizing the positive aspects of this technology, and addressing any concerns or questions that your listener may have, you can help to build a more informed and positive view of cryptocurrency.

To summarize: Cryptocurrencies offer decentralized, secure, transparent, efficient, and innovative solutions for individuals and businesses, making them a compelling option in the modern digital economy.",1676581710,j8tj1fh,CryptoCurrency,2023-02-16 21:08:30,2
