yourlifeisadream,"A hard question. If we are just going by some of the titans or newer/recent additions to the crypto ladder,


1. **Solana** is Solana, although it has had a great run in advertisement, adoption in Opera, and elsewise just a next-gen breakout ( along with Polkadot and Cosmos for example ) we all know of the outages. Centralized as hell and facing many problems, they aren't doing it right at all. They're a joke now and I profited during their initial jump up to $200, but once the outages happened the first time and I saw their reaction, I bailed.


2. **Polkadot** just lost its CEO, putting them in a new position. I have not studied them as much and tbh, this is because they haven't had much controversy as the others. The others take the spotlight and Polkadot really hasn't, but with Gavin stepping down, I plan to delve into their history more. Throughout my time studying, ( and I did take breaks ) I didn't see as much crap on them as all the others. 


3. **XRP** what can I say? They're in court and whatever the decision is, is what decides if they are considered a security or not. I don't trust David Schwartz at all, but I do acknowledge the XRP ledger and his competence. Either way, the courts muddy the water right now and there's no point in talking about XRP until they're out of hot water, at least here.


4. **Polygon** and **Arbitrum** as examples have climbed the ranks of TVL's, and though they could or could not be said to be doing it "" right "" if we go by fulfilling the ethics of what crypto should be, remains to be determined. 


The layer 2's having gained so much TVL and such rapid increase while still being relatively new to the crypto world and, in reflection, it's still too soon to determine exactly what roles layer 2's will play long-term. I would want to wait longer before I assessed layer 2's, because they are just still so new tech for one, new to being on the top as they are in TVL, and crypto is just still so young.


Layer-2's are meant to fulfill their purposes but as we see with **Polygon** who keeps acquiring partnerships, and growing itself, as we see chains die off and their own chains grow, it's untold the possibilities that could happen with them. We could theorize ( could layer 2's become their own dominant chains or perhaps function in a similar way to parachains? ( I don't mean in exact function, merely layer 2's have their own ecosystem/purposes. Now, I'm not saying AT ALL before anyone reading thinks that I'm saying that L2's/parachains have the same functionality, just making a comparison in the "" similarities of possibility "" concerning L2's and parachains functioning as separate but integral/crucial ecosystems that, as they already both are proving, they are important to their respective chains they interact with.


5. **TRON** Personally wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole just cause of the founder being controversial. It's been in the game forever and an older chain, one I do not study or look into due to the fact I just don't consider it to be anything in the future. Perhaps someone else could educate me here.


6. I suppose next we could go to **Avalanche** but here I would confess of the major players that rose up during/before the fall of **Terra**  this is one I haven't studied. I have never invested in them nor desired to try, for the other projects offer more.


You see, the problem lies in;


Are they doing it right ------- Am I gonna make monies from holding üí∞ 


I do not think the two, in the current scene, are not widely or even necessarily compatible. I think Ethereum has a chance to shape up for example, but that it is not doing it "" right "". It is a dominant chain that will, if it pulls through its problems, survive and cement itself.

gistya,"I feel like people are being too perfectionistic. Any system will have its pros and cons.

Consider REST, a client-server communications scheme. The original proposal for REST is very clear it has downsides, such as requiring scripts to run on the client, which could have a performance and security impact. Javascript and web browsers eventually demonstrated the pros and cons of REST, but it's still the best solution to the problem after 20 years despite its warts.

I think the success of Bitcoin inspired a lot of people to become interested in crypto and the potential of open, decentralized ledgers. The idea of Ethereum, e.g. smart contracts, is one of many ways people have tried to innovate on this concept.

But I think it also attracted a lot of utopians who quickly started to see only the general downsides of the technology. Engineers like to solve problems, so people started thinking of ways to have our cake and eat it too. How can we get rid of the annoying things about Bitcoin, like having warehouses full of computers? 

The problem is, some of these problems were just side-effects or costs of the system's core values. Every benefit always comes at a cost, and having lots of computers crunching numbers is the cost of not having to trust one specific computer to ensure the integrity of the blockchain. PoS Eth 2 thought it could solve this by just randomly selecting a single validator, but this shows that the authors of that scheme did not understand all the reasons why it's critical to have consensus from many sources. It's not just so that no one source can game the system or ""misbehave""‚Äîit's also so that there is never a time when one entity can control which blocks can get added to the chain.

My question is, why did people like Vitalik Buterin not fully understand the benefit of proof of consensus? The US OFAC situation proves why it's a big deal, but I'm pretty surprised if the supposed experts in this field simply did not understand the risk of moving completely away from crowdsourcing.",1666383628,it8z300,CryptoCurrency,2022-10-21 20:20:28,2

gistya,"What is troubling for a lot of people is the impact that US govt. regulations and sanctions might have on encouraging or requiring censorship behavior by validators, which arose after US OFAC went after Coinbase and others related to TornadoCash being targeted as a money-laundering system.

Like what if the govt. says it's illegal to validate blocks containing any transactions from some address? Half or more of the Eth network will have to comply with that to avoid jail/sanctions. Depending how the legalities and realities of this shake out, some people are skeptical Ethereum can survive as a unified global system without getting forked into multiple chains that vary on which major nation they comply with. It's not hard to imagine separate US, China, Russia, and EU forks being forced into existence.

I think there could be a creative solution to this, but I highly doubt it would resemble anything similar to Ethereum's Proof of Stake system, which seems inherently flawed due to the identity of validators being known. Being randomly selected for each slot does not solve the problem at all, because if 25% or 50% or 60% of the network might refuse to validate a given block, that's an apocalypse.

Bitcoin or Eth PoW are resistant to this problem because if 50-60% of the network refuses to try to compute a hash for a given block, the other 40-50% will still do it (it just might take longer). The cost of that resiliency is the extra energy cost, but it seems worth it if it's the only way to have a global blockchain free of govt. censorship.

Awhodothey,"&gt;the use cases you‚Äôre thinking about are too narrow

No the use case of multiple trustless parties interacting with a smart contract simultaneously is 90% of most L1's txs. On most chains you won't find a single block that doesn't contain a tx that wouldn't be broken by concurrency. That's why Cardano went a full year without a single simple x*y=k trustless DEX. Honestly, I'm not sure if they even have one yet. Even their most popular wallets are trusted, closed source code. Cardano is by far the least decentralized L1 I have seen. Even BSC dapps and wallets are trustless. 

&gt;To my knowledge the L1 is a settlement layer, so the entire chain is designed to scale out into L2, meaning what actually gets settled on L1 isn‚Äôt individual transactions like you might see on Ethereum.

Most ETH txs are on L2. Cardano does not have a computational layer. All cardano txs are L1 individual txs. Plutus only posts script hashes on chain, which reduces state bloat, but increases computational resources for validators. The separate computational layer that was marketed for years was abandoned without any announcements. Cardano does not have any general purpose L2s, nor have they published any papers on one. Hydra is state channels and will ultimately have all of the limitations of lightning... someday. 

It will have Cardano's eUTXO, but it is not a general purpose L2 that users can interact with individually, and most L1 use cases beyond trusted party payment processing are not possible in a sharded, concurrent state. Charles knows this, and he knows that you do not. Cardano has only now begun to start building rollups that will be necessary to have an L2 and catch up to everyone else. Charles called rollups ""an academic concept"" and said he choose not to develop them after preliminary research on them because he thought zk RUs were ""5-10 years away."" In reality they are simply impossible to implement on Cardano unless they fork and change their parameters to increase data availability, which they will probably have to do. 

And then they will have to deal with Cardano's exceptionally low throughput and extremely long finality time. Cardano was designed for a computation layer and hydra, not rollups. Neither idea were finished research when they started building Cardano, and their research did not support Charle's initial claims about what would be possible. Seven years later, the only thing they have is a bridge to a BSC fork. 

This is way too complicated of a project to trust to someone like Charles who has zero developing experience. He talked to a bunch of academics, came up with a great sales pitch, raised a bunch of money exaggerating the most optimistic scenario, hired a bunch of smart academics, and has delivered absolutely nothing that can compete with any chain that started development after 2015.

He lied that Cardano's TVL was only low because defillama didn't count unlocked staking. He lied when he said ""over a hundred"" Ethereum dapps had told him that they were going to migrate to Cardano. He lied in 2020 when he claimed Cardano would have ""thousands of dapps"" ""by this time next year"" despite knowing that no one had started working and that Plutus was no where near ready to release a test environment for devs. He lied in 2018 when he said that IELE was ""a couple months away"" from main net release and that would allow Ethereum and other chain's devs to port their apps straight to Cardano. He lied and that IOG had tested a uniswap fork on plutus testnet and it worked ""perfectly"" and that ""there is no concurrency problem."" He lied on the Lex Fridman podcast and said that Hydra would be able to run a uniswap type DEX that users would directly interact with (which the hydra docs explicitly say is not possible). I don't know how many times he lied and suggested that probably correct haskell would reduce smart contract exploits, despite almost no smart contracts being provably correct because they are computed in non-deterministic environments off chain.

So if you can spend say 10000 dollars on an altcoin, have that altcoin go up say 3x relative to Bitcoin, and then trade that altcoin for Bitcoin and end up with 3x more Bitcoin than you would have if you had just spent that initial money on Bitcoin, then that would be success. It doesn‚Äôt just have to be Bitcoin though, could be Ethereum if you like Ethereum for instance.

But just as an example I got the free Uniswap airdrop, which was 400 Uni tokens, I sold them for a about 0.25 Bitcoin pretty soon after. The price of Uni bottomed in December 2020, and I bought back the 400 tokens for about 0.05 Bitcoin, and then I somehow sold the top of Uniswap mid 2021 and got another 0.3 Bitcoin. So I managed to turn a free airdrop about half a Bitcoin.

I had a lot of luck with Solana, Cardano, and Binance Coin as well.

&gt;Elon Musk outright manipulates markets to his whim and fancy and seems to find it a fun game that he partakes in gleefully as investors may lose their life savings, futures and family funds. 

Musk exercises his right to Free Speech, by commetning on things. If idiots decide to invest based on jokes he tweets about Doge, that's on them, not Musk. Musk has no legal or moral obligation to self-censor, because what he does by tweeting is not ""manipulate markets"".

&gt;He talks a big game about free speech but has started permanently suspending accounts that ""impersonate others"", which are generally actually obvious account parodies especially those done to him. 

When those accounts are using the exact same tactic that scammers use to deceive people, which is to copy the display name and profile picture of a famous person's account, then it's no longer just parody, it's deception, and fair game for banning.

&gt;He also plays a certain segment of crypto ""investors"" like fiddles who pump the market and get dumped on when he ""doesn't follow through"" on a tweet and heavily suggest ideas he has no intention of implementing.

Morning_Star_Ritual,"Let‚Äôs shovel the dubious speculation.


‚Äî Most people who don‚Äôt game as a hobby don‚Äôt realize how much people spend on skins. (See: 150k CSGO gun skin, Diablo Immortal 100k whale).

‚Äî Skins can be thought of as NFTs, except you can‚Äôt sell them (other then a few games) or even gift them. You rent them. People will spend thousands on skins or in-game assets and just walk away from the game when they get bored.

‚Äî Despite the hate of NFTs in the gaming community, lurk around some gaming subs. You will see a few NFT avatars. Reddit just Trojan horsed NFTs. You even see NFT avatars in the Bitcoin sub‚Ä¶which still doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.

‚Äî Much of the hate towards crypto could have been due to the price scalpers sold GPUs due to Ethereum mining.

‚Äî Once a game does for skins, what Reddit did for PFP NFTs,  there could be a sea change‚Ä¶potentially a massive one.

What would that pivot be? When will it happen? Who knows. But it‚Äôs possible gamers will demand true ownership of their skins‚Ä¶..SkiNFTs? 

In a few years it could seem ludicrous to be expected to spend $20 on a skin and not be able to trade, sell or gift on a native marketplace. No need to sell your entire account. They probably won‚Äôt be called NFTs. But they will be based on blockchain technology.


I suspect what Dr Disrespect‚Äôs project is doing could be a catalyst for this shift. Like Reddit, the project tones down the use of the word NFTs. They will allow players to buy skins in what they call a ‚Äúcentralized‚Äù account. No need for a wallet or an NFT. But a year later, if/when they see how much the OG skins they own are selling on the marketplace, they can convert their assets to a ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù account. And not get slammed with gas fees, like Reddit, they are using matic.

I believe this model has the best chance‚Äîoffering real ownership of skins/digital assets‚Äîof flipping the current system.

I hope so.

the merge is when the Ethereum blockchain will change from a proof of work (mining) system to a proof of stake (validating) system. this will make ethereum much more energy efficient, more secure, and either deflationary or very close to it.

it also allows sharding/data blobs to be implemented, which will reduce gas fees and block times by a significant amount.

So your Rocket Pool actually has a Ratio that is updated daily for rEth:Eth so ,  no thanks :)) ... Binance had 1:1 ratio for any Beth:Eth swap after the lock period has ended ... so no, they are not the same. And you really believe the stake rewards will differ so much between these options? If something Binance should offer more under lock than the open LP style. 

Sorry mate but to much risk , dunno who Rocket Pool is runned by, the lack of 1:1 parity insurance is wierdly not in the retail user favor , and the stake rewards are not even quantifiable to compare anything.

ShadyCryptoGuy,"There are 2 criteria's for this:

1. You'd need exchanges to be easily accessible, which means no kyc for a lot of people, especially minors since they can't buy crypto themselves while they are allowed to have a bank account under guardian approval, see an issue here?
2. IF crypto bought on exchanges are to be kept in cold wallets for security purposes, the crypto wallet needs to be very simple, probably more simple than what we have now because as easy as it seems to most of us here we are generally nerds, meaning that we are more comfortable with the interface and the technology behind it than the majority

Criteria 2 is an issue since wallet addresses may be too complicated for some people, a possible solution to this would be something like ENS (Ethereum name service) but it would be costly in some cases since you can't have multiple accounts with the same name so people will have to pay large money for an easy name which people will scalp.

MinimalGravitas,"That's a good point and one that's been raised quite a bit in the community. There's actually multiple groups discussing how to offset those historic emission, as is always the case in Ethereum, decentralization sometimes means the appearance of chaos, but results in the best outcomes eventually. This current stumbling block is that there just aren't enough carbon offsets available onchain yet. The two biggest providers (Toucan and Moss) have only onboarded about 10% of what would be needed, and of these Toucan's BCTs are of a lower quality than their NCTs or Moss's offsets, so the real total available if we insist on the most trustworthy and legitimate offsets is even lower.

For the time being you can use https://carbon.fyi/ to find out the emissions your wallet has been responsible for and then either offset them onchain, or of course just take that number and purchase offsets from a normal offchain source.

I expect it to be much clearer to the crypto community, after the vasil hard fork has been in place for a year or two. Until then, I expect the sheer amount of investment in Ethereum to date to continue to promote these maximalist narratives.

SakuraNinja12,"Q: Will The Merge reduce my Ethereum gas fees?

A: No. The switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake does not actually change anything about the network that would lead to lower gas fees. It‚Äôs only with later improvements, including the 2023 sharding upgrade, that should see Ethereum's throughput dramatically increase as blocks are produced in parallel ‚Äî bringing down fees as a result.

Q: Will The Merge increase Ethereum transaction times?

A: No. The Merge will actually slightly decrease Ethereum transaction times. Under proof-of-work, Ethereum generates a block every 12-14 seconds (currently averaging at 13.36 seconds). Following The Merge, a new block will be generated every 12 seconds ‚Äî more than 10% faster than before. This will mean transactions will be confirmed roughly 10% faster in most cases.

Q: Will The Merge cause Ethereum to go offline?

A: No. Ethereum will continue to operate during The Merge. However, many exchanges will likely pause deposits and withdrawals on the Ethereum network for several hours while The Merge is carried out.

Q: What will Ethereum miners do after The Merge?

A: Ethereum miners will no longer be able to help secure the network following the merge, and as such, will no longer earn block rewards. Some miners may transition to other GPU-mined proof-of-work coins like Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Ravencoin. They might also dedicate their hardware to other GPU-intensive activities, such as machine learning or rendering farms. There is also a fair chance that a POW Ethereum fork will arise, which will allow miners to continue their operations.

Q: Will staking APR increase after The Merge?

A: Ethereum.org notes that staking yields are likely to increase after The Merge, as transaction fees begin to go to validators, rather than miners. The site predicts that APR for staking on Ethereum will increase to ~7% after The Merge. Research earlier this year from Coinbase predicted that staking yields would increase to over 9-12% APR, based on the fact that the Beacon Chain‚Äôs staking reward was between 4.3-5.4%.

Q: Can staked ETH be withdrawn after The Merge?

A: Not right away. Staked ETH will remain locked on the beacon chain for around 6-12 months, until the Shanghai upgrade takes place. Validators will need to exit the active validator set to withdraw staked ETH. There is a limit to the number of validators that can leave each epoch. Withdrawals will be enabled following the planned Shanghai upgrade.

Q: Is The Merge the same as ETH 2.0?

A: Eth 2 is now known as the consensus layer, whereas the original POW chain (Eth 1) is known as the execution layer. Together, these are known simply as Ethereum.

Q: How many ETH do you need to stake to run a node after The Merge?

A: Following The Merge, you'll still need to stake at least 32 ETH to activate your own validator. However, you will also be able to share a validator with other people through pooled staking (including liquid staking solutions), staking-as-a-service platforms, and centralized exchanges. If you don‚Äôt have 32 ETH to stake, you can also run a node that does not propose blocks ‚Äî this will still support the network by listening for new blocks to verify them.

Q: What is the Goerli testnet?

A: Goerli is one of a handful of Ethereum testnets. It is used by developers looking to bug and stress test their applications before deploying on the Ethereum mainnet. It was the last testnet to complete the merge and switch to proof-of-stake, setting the stage for the main event in September.

Q: Will Ethereum use shard chains after The Merge?

A: No. Shard chains are not expected to be implemented until 2023.

I'm not a dev but I would love to see more discussions about how the crypto industry might think about smart contract development going forward. I understand that all of these things are true at once:

- The vast majority of Smart Contract developers know Solidity. It offers a huge advantage to any new project that allows copy/paste functionality of existing Ethereum smart contracts to their own eco systems.

- Smart Contract developers represent a tiny portion of developers overall; designing platforms with more popular language compatibility offers a pool of developers an order of magnitude larger to draw from.

- Enforcing more restrictive programing paradigms can offer much better security and auditability of correctness for the type of applications that smart contracts are actually deployed to do.

It's really interesting how these somewhat contradictory layers of network effects and path dependencies play out in the short and longer term.

MonopolyMan720,"I want to preface this by saying that I've talked to Applied Blockchain who has [worked directly with Intel](https://www.intel.co.uk/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/documents/final-pdf-applied-blockchain-and-intel-sgx-12.pdf) on confidential compute solutions and blockchain. The threat here is real and it's part of the reason why they haven't gone decentralized yet. They are working with banks right now and essentially provide a centralized oracle for securely doing bank data queries against the bank's API.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Several of these require direct hardware access to the device (such as VoltPillager) which severely reduces the realistic threat of attack.

How can you say that when talking about a blockchain network? The idea is that anyone can run a node. This is like saying people that run mining rigs don't have access to their GPUs.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Even these do not provide an attacker with the private data.

The real threat here is access to the keys, [which these vulnerabilities can do](https://github.com/KitMurdock/plundervolt/tree/master/sgx_crt_rsa), which in turn can give access to data.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Further, isn't this exactly why blockchain is a wonderful companion to TEE environments? Wouldn't you need to compromise the majority of nodes, meaning you'd need to get access to the majority of nodes keys or hardware environments all at the same time?

If we were talking about non-confidential consensus, then yes TEEs are another layer of security (in-fact that's why Applied Blockchain will be using SGX for their Algorand &lt;&gt; Ethereum bridge). When we're talking about confidential compute, however, there is no way to keep a single node in check.

Let's say someone deploys a smart contract on Sapphire where there are funds locked in a smart contract that can only be withdrawn with a password: `hunter2`. When a user wants to withdraw funds they send a transaction to the network with the password `hunter2` in the application call. This transaction is encrypted and sent to multiple nodes for consensus. If one of those nodes is compromised, the node runner can read that the password is `hunter2` and use it at any time they want to drain the contract's account. This is all done while consensus does it's thing and original end-user will have no idea that the malicious node runner got their password until it's too late. The threat here takes place outside of consensus.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Are there even any real world examples of SGX compromises or are they all theoretical ""hey, SGX is vulnerable"" white hat alarms?

Not sure about this but part of the reason we might not have seen one is due to the security model. The security model, as Intel pointed out, is assuming there isn't physical access. My understanding is that the most common use-case of SGX is when someone wants to do remote compute securely in a datacenter. Those data centers already have physical security in their threat model. The chance of a malicious attacker getting physical access to a system in a secure datacenter is very unlikely. The chance of someone running a node on a blockchain network having physical access to the hardware is 100%.  I assume this is part of the reason SGX was deprecated in consumer CPUs.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Sorry, SMPC, the T stuck itself in there. Secure Multi Party Compute, which is what they're using currently with Meta to help obscure confidential details of survey participants.

Similar to federated learning, this is a specific implementation detail that doesn't apply to the network as a whole.

Crypto payments make no sense currently. There's no reason to pay with cryptocurrency if you think its going to appreciate in value and you can't encourage people to use your crypto without simultaneously encouraging holding (POS rewards etc). 

Its slower. Its less accepted. You need to kyc and transfer fiat to buy it in most cases.

Nobody other than the board of the company gives a shit about that company unless they were getting something out of it. The assumption that people go into crypto solely to support the tech would be like saying they would invest into Apple simply because they want to see the development of new iPhones and nothing else.


The problem we have in crypto world is that we have very far and few actual companies developing a product that will see a return. There are a couple great gems in the mix. Unlike Apple, most shit coins are trading on complete bullshit (website, white paper, and a bunch of random techs smiling in the stock profile pics). A small percentage of coins are pioneering the space, and the rest is a giant speculative roulette table that is fuelled by straight up gambling.  


In saying all this, we are the early adopters of crypto. We deserve a reward for investing in it before the masses do. Yes, we are still early adopters even in 2022. Until we see mass adoption; the oil market pegged to Ethereum, or half the developing countries in the world paying for food in crypto instead of regular corrupt government backed garbage, we are the early adopters. We deserve the reward for the risks of coming in before it gets regulated to hell and back.


There is nothing wrong with wanting a reward. The real adoption phase will come when people get their reward and don‚Äôt have to cash out to banks or an atm.

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 2nd place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #Ethereum Con Argument 
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclosure: I currently hold a position in ETH, ~53% of my current portfolio value*
&gt; - Tweaking my argument from [the last round](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pz4vav/rcc_cointest_top_10_ethereum_conarguments_october/hq6gy23/) 
&gt; - ETH has been the subject of a lot of criticism over the years and the same points still seem to get recycled ([premine/founders](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owypvc/my_personal_investigation_into_ethereum_uncovers/), [DAO rollback](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao), [scalability/centralization](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qw2e32/eth_is_bad_and_i_am_tired_of_pretending_its_not/hl0bqo9/), [inflation/supply](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-ethereum)). There are a ton of rebuttals online for the most common Con arguments - [see here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/najp2c/addressing_common_criticisms_about_ethereum/) and [here](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) for a start. 
&gt; 
&gt; - That being said, there are definitely some legitimate concerns about ETH to consider: 
&gt; 
&gt; ##Gotta pay the troll toll
&gt; 
&gt; - As a protocol, Ethereum is an '[empire](https://www.finder.com.au\/brave-new-worlds-cosmos-blockchain-and-social-evolution)', a self-contained ecosystem with [composability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- But the downside of a 'one chain to rule them all' approach is that it locks users into using the system and paying gas fees in ETH. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) is certainly an industry standard, but [interoperability](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/why-is-interoperability-important-for-blockchain) may be crypto's future. As Do Kwon of LUNA said recently: ""[Maybe it's a bad idea to stick all the applications into one global computer. Maybe it just makes sense to have a multi-chain future.](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1439969124550119431)"" Vitalik agrees, [but differentiates between a *multi-chain* vs. a *cross-chain* future](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/).
&gt; 
&gt; - We all know [gas fees](https://www.gasprice.io/) on ETH are a pain in the ass. 
&gt;     -  A lot of complaints about gas are misguided or uninformed, not understanding the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition), mistakenly believing EIP1559 was supposed to lower gas fees (vs. [making them more predictable](https://pintail.xyz/posts/gas-market-analysis/)), or suggesting that ['gas fees are high, no one will use Ethereum'](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qikr7r/a_10k_eth_is_not_unrealistic_it_is_inevitable/hik9pet/). 
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High gas fees are in fact an indication of usage, of [people competing to use the chain](https://cryptofees.info/) - but this makes ETH a victim of its own success.
&gt; 
&gt; - Paying [$20 for a token transfer or a Uniswap trade](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) is just not feasible for users with less capital - [they get priced out of using the chain](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdi9i8/ive_tried_to_use_ethereum_1015_times_over_the/).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- A really interesting article dives deeper into how ""[people are entirely 'locked out' of their funds since it‚Äôd cost more in transaction fees to move the funds than the funds are actually worth.](https://medium.com/geekculture/value-fragmentation-8c8336f97cfd)"" At the time of writing the total 'lost value' of ERC20s was $600M, which doesn't include ETH itself or NFTs. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Which brings us to competition and scalability:
&gt; 
&gt; ##I drink your milkshake
&gt; 
&gt; - Having prioritized decentralization and security at the expense of scalability, Ethereum is now [focused on rollups to meet demand](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html).
&gt; 
&gt; -  However, some users may not care about decentralization - they want to participate in DeFi, NFTs, etc. without paying an arm and a leg and will use BSC, SOL or [sidechains that don't inherit ETH's security](https://finematics.com/polygon-commit-chain-explained/).
&gt; 	- [Funds have migrated](https://ethhole.link/) over the past year from ETH [via bridges to L2s and other L1s](https://medium.com/etherscan-blog/ethereum-bridges-four-months-on-10ee36f889ae).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- [TVL on L2s has boomed](https://l2beat.com/) as users flock to platforms with [cheaper transactions](https://l2fees.info/). Polygon for instance recently [flipped Ethereum in daily active addresses](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/04/polygon-flips-ethereum-on-active-user-addresses/).
&gt; 
&gt; - Ryan Selkis of Messari explained some concerns around these trends, suggesting that ETH's position will eroded by competitors and/or cannibalized by L2s:
&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt;[""Decentralization (specifically political decentralization) and architectural soundness have become secondary properties at best and willfully ignored at worst in the mercenary dominant market of 2021. Not every new chain has tossed decentralization aside, but many have. Even if Ethereum manages to hold off its largest non-EVM rivals, it will leak value to the rollup chains it leans on for scalability. ETH sits at ~60% market cap dominance among Layer 1s. That will either fall below 50% in 2022, or its Layer 2 rollup tokens will eat into its growth. Maybe both.] (https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf)""
&gt; 
&gt; ##Points of failure?
&gt; 
&gt; - While I agree with [this article debunking the ""ETH is centralized"" mantra](https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-isnt-decentralized-and-other-myths-ef2d132ee1fe), I think Ethereum still has some progress to make on the [**sociopolitical** and **architectural** aspects of decentralization](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274#.355j5eg0v):
&gt; 
&gt; - **Sociopolitics**:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- Vitalik is a great steward of the project and has been [trying to remove himself as a single point of failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x1b_S6Qp2Q&amp;t=656s). Anyone remember the [Vitalik death hoax?](https://fortune.com/2017/06/26/vitalik-death/)
&gt; 
&gt;         - But as a 'high priest', Vitalik's [vision](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html), [proposals](https://news.coincu.com/38718-vitalik-buterin-makes-proposal-eip-4488-to-lower-gas-fees-for-ethereum-layer-2-in-the-short-term/) and opinions have preeminent influence and there's no doubt [he remains the 'face' of Ethereum](https://time.com/6158182/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-profile/). The community looks to him for key communications like [roadmap updates](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1466411377107558402).
&gt; 
&gt;         * While [Ethereum development functions as an open source collaboration](https://media.consensys.net/ethereum-2-0s-latest-strides-forward-13f63652e57d?gi=30830fb85bbd), I think there are a lot of benefits to having a pseudonymous, 'absent' founder like with Bitcoin and Monero. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - There are also some concerns in my mind about the role of Joe Lubin and ConsenSys in [privatizing what should arguably be public goods](https://saitoofficial.medium.com/the-infura-problem-fe68866484ec). 
&gt; 
&gt; - **Architecture**: 
&gt; 
&gt;     * ConsenSys has been a huge player in [driving enterprise adoption](https://consensys.net/blog/news/consensys-acquires-jpm-quorum/) - but they also own [key Ethereum infrastructure like Infura and MetaMask](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/02/consensys-shareholders-readying-legal-action-over-share-valuation/). They're now being [audited for letting banks like JPMorgan Chase get a piece of the pie](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blockchain-company-consensys-faces-multi-billion-dollar-audit-as-shareholders-claim-board-breaches-fiduciary-duties---attributed-to-arthur-falls-301493433.html).
&gt; 
&gt;      - [Crypto Twitter](https://twitter.com/infura_io/status/1499446959827931175) seemed surprised to learn that MetaMask and Infura aren't actually permissionless [when users in some countries lost access](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/136336/a-look-at-metamask-infura-opensea-and-the-countries-they-do-not-serve).
&gt; 
&gt;      - Bigger incidents like [Infura going down](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereums-infura-iating-outage-revives-decentralization-concerns) or the [Geth bug causing a chain split](https://decrypt.co/79597/ethereum-blockchain-splits-software-bug-network) highlight the Ethereum network's reliance on this infrastructure. 
&gt;

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Maleficent_Plankton which won 1st place in the Ethereum Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Ethereum has drastically changed in the past year now that it has rebranded itself as **Consensus/Settlement layer** for other Layer 2 Execution/Rollup networks. It is no longer trying to be a monolithic blockchain by itself. Because of this shift in design, many of its former CONs are no longer major issues. And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.
&gt; 
&gt; I discuss the PROs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:
&gt; 
&gt; ## PROs
&gt; 
&gt; **First-mover advantage** (major):
&gt; 
&gt; Like Bitcoin, Ethereum enjoys a first-mover advantage. Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development. Theoretically, if Ethereum and Algorand were both released today with a fair start, Algorand would win easily. But because of the first-mover advantage, Ethereum easily trounces its competitors in security and popularity, and those competitors have little chance of catching up.
&gt; 
&gt; **Resilient to spam and Denial-of-Service attacks** (moderate):
&gt; 
&gt; Due to high gas fees on the Ethereum network, it is extremely resistant to DDoS attacks and spam attacks. Ethereum is battle-tested and hasn't sufferred a major DDoS attack since 2016.
&gt; 
&gt; Its competitors are still dealing with DDoS attacks. Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 3 times near the end of 2021, there are huge complaints from the crypto community. You need a huge amount of memory and bandwidth to keep up with fast networks like Solana. Similarly, Polygon suffered an unintentional DDoS attack from [Sunflower Farmers game](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/polygon-under-accidental-attack-from-swarm-of-sunflower-farmers/) in Jan 6. For several days, bots ground the network to a halt.
&gt; 
&gt; **Long-term scalability as a settlement layer** (major):
&gt; 
&gt; Ethereum has long-term scalability through Layer 2 rollups. It can offload all its data bloat and computations off-chain.
&gt; 
&gt; Many monolithic blockchains are fine for now, but they eventually all suffer from massive data bloat on their blockchains unless they also offload to Layer 2 solutions. When this happens, they will be playing catch-up with Ethereum.
&gt; 
&gt; **Economic sustainability** (major):
&gt; 
&gt; Most other blockchains have enjoy lower fees because they have unsustainable reward systems for their miners or stakers. Polygon PoS distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees. Solana collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)]. Cardano rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years. Bitcoin pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees. When their subsidies disappear, unless they have major governance changes, these networks are either going to see much higher fees, or their security is going to decrease drastically.
&gt; 
&gt; Due to its extremely-high fees, Ethereum is economically sustainable. Its amount of inflation is now mostly offset by the amount burned per transaction due to EIP-1559.

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Tritador which won 3rd place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; The problems with Ethereum do not need a lengthy explanation. Simply put, the technology is old and inefficient, and almost seems like it was designed more as a proof of concept than as a serious attempt to create a cryptocurrency network.
&gt; 
&gt; Ethereum is just plain bad at what it was designed to do. It is functional, and was the first crypto to introduce an amazing array of functionality to the crypto-universe. At the time, that was absolutely ground-breaking, and extremely important for the development of the crypto-universe.  But today, it is time for ETH to step aside for better crypto that was designed properly out of the gate, to do what ETH was intended to do the right way.
&gt; 
&gt; Ethereum was not designed for efficiency or scale. It was just designed to work. And it works. That is all it does.
&gt; 
&gt; The average investor has absolutely no practical use for a slow, congested crypto network that takes ages to accomplish basic actions and costs hundreds of dollars in gas fees to move tens of dollars of cryptocurrency around.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is why fewer and fewer people use Ethereum for its intended purpose. Ethereum has instead become an investment asset like bitcoin, but it takes a back seat to the far more established and well-known bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; There are other cryptocurrencies that do everything Ethereum was designed to do and more, and they do it better, faster, and cheaper, right out of the gate. Meanwhile, Ethereum is desperately being upgraded, trying to play catch up at the very game it invented.

Below is an argument written by jeff406 which won 3rd place in the Ethereum Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **It seems like the vast majority of arguments against Ethereum focus on one thing: gas fees. With several great sidechains/L2s in the greater Ethereum ecosystem, why is this still a problem?**
&gt; 
&gt; Regardless of how cheap transaction fees are on loopring, polygon, arbitrum, et cetera, most users will still be outpriced by the fees needed to bridge off L1 Ethereum in the first place. As more exchanges introduce the ability to withdraw directly to L2/sidechains, this issue will no longer be relevant. Until then, fiat onramps provide another easy way to avoid the high bridging fees.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, high L1 gas fees should serve as an intriguing indicator for the utility of the Ethereum network. These fees would not have become so exorbitant to begin with if it weren't for the excellent dApp opportunities in the Ethereum ecosystem. I have often seen this compared to the housing prices in NYC; yes, they are expensive, but that's because of the value you receive by having miners process your Ethereum transactions.
&gt; 
&gt; When there is no longer a need to manually bridge from L1, ETH is an obvious winner for investors big and small. The Ethereum ecosystem has a tremendous variety of dApps, large amounts of liquidity, and is home to some of the most valuable NFT collections. As blockchain technology improves and evolves, Ethereum will remain the centerpiece around which new scaffolding is built.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Updated from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pfoo0a/rcc_cointest_general_concepts_nft_conarguments/hd7ew7q/):
&gt; 
&gt; *Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them*
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases related to proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from Kraken](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - The first negative that often comes to mind is probably the cost of minting and transferring NFTs. Small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is usually specific to scalability issues of the Ethereum network, rather than NFTs broadly (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos, Solana, Cosmos, Cardano, Algorand etc.). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount the other big negative that often gets mentioned - [environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change) - which similarly conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains.
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) and [phishing](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/20/22943228/opensea-phishing-hack-smart-contract-bug-stolen-nft) are certainly present with NFTs. Chainalysis recently posted an interesting report about the prevalence of [wash trading and money laundering in NFT markets](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-preview-nft-wash-trading-money-laundering/). 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;         - On the one hand, it's cool that the transparency of the blockchain allows anyone to trace this activity (more so than in traditional art markets). Like the case of[ Melania Trump's NFT sale](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vpx8/analyzing-the-very-bizarre-sale-of-melania-trumps-dollar170000-nft). Or trying to disentangle the [web of influence around celebrities buying NFTs](https://maxread.substack.com/p/mapping-the-celebrity-nft-complex).
&gt; 
&gt;         - But it also indicates that maybe the value of NFTs is less about digital scarcity/trustlessness and more about social engineering/manufactured hype. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - Other murky practices would be stuff like [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which really undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Additional exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89) or using smart contracts to [bypass a sales cap, like with the Adidas NFT drop](https://twitter.com/Montana_Wong/status/1472023753865396227).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) points us to an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;         - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Maleficent_Plankton which won 1st place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Ethereum has drastically changed in the past year now that it has rebranded itself as **Consensus/Settlement layer** for other Layer 2 Execution/Rollup networks. It is no longer trying to be a monolithic blockchain by itself. Because of this shift in design, many of its former CONs are no longer major issues. And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.
&gt; 
&gt; I discuss the CONs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:
&gt; 
&gt; ## CONs
&gt; 
&gt; **Gas Fees** (major):
&gt; 
&gt; The biggest complaint for Ethereum is its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it's the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it's often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin's native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees.
&gt; 
&gt; Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021.
&gt; 
&gt; And that's just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can't be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It's impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees.
&gt; 
&gt; In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum's account-based model compared to Bitcoin's and Cardano's UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks.
&gt; 
&gt; **Competition from other Smart Contract networks** (moderate):
&gt; 
&gt; Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano?
&gt; 
&gt; Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum's Layer 2 rollup solutions will be.
&gt; 
&gt; **Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions** (major):
&gt; 
&gt; Ethereum's long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions.
&gt; 
&gt; These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users.
&gt; 
&gt; Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they're stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption.
&gt; 
&gt; Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won't be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses.
&gt; 
&gt; Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there's always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers).
&gt; 
&gt; **ZK Rollups** require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors** (moderate):
&gt; 
&gt; The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it's a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won't merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don't know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don't know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks.
&gt; 
&gt; **MEV and Dark Forest attacks** (minor):
&gt; 
&gt; [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners.
&gt; 
&gt; **Final Word**
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network.

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by bkcrypt0 which won 2nd place in the Ethereum Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Ethereum is the Microsoft of Blockchains -- nobody really likes to use it, but it's just too big and established to fail.
&gt; 
&gt; There is something to first mover advantage in tech revolutions. The companies that establish themselves early as a platform, become the de facto standard. Ethereum is that standard, despite the high fees and congestion.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Their developer network is well established with teams building on the platform at an incredible rate.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Ethereum has captured most of the big use cases for crypto, and the number of ERC-20 tokens reflect that. 
&gt; - The top 20 defi projects by total value locked are all ERC-20 compliant (https://defipulse.com/)
&gt; - The biggest NFT platform (Opensea) ‚Äî built for Ethereum. The highest amount of money paid for NFTs ‚Äî again, ETH. 
&gt; 
&gt; 3. The technology is slow, but solid. Nodes are decentralized. There‚Äôs little to no downtime. The roadmap is clear to shift to proof-of-stake and eventually sharding that will lighten the main chain processing load. 
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Owners of ETH are voting with their tokens wit a high percentage of circulating supply locked in staking. That‚Äôs an enormous vote of confidence in the tech and platform.

Below is an argument written by idevcg which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; 1. Bitcoin has the highest liquidity of all crypto currencies.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Bitcoin has ""immaculate conception""; it was completely fairly launched with no 'pre-mine"". Furthermore, there were no VCs or other big players who just went in and bought huge amounts at the start. Anyone could have gotten in, and this is no longer replicable by any new cryptocurrencies even if they try to make a fair launch.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. It is by far the most decentralized cryptocurrency in existence. It's founder is not only still anonymous, but he is no longer working on the project. Bitcoin is the only coin with a sizeable following that is no longer controlled or heavily influenced by a founder(s), which is a potential attack vector for malicious actors.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. PoW is more secure than PoS, and the Bitcoin blockchain is by far the most secure PoW network (especially after Ethereum moves to PoS) with the greatest hashing requirements.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Bitcoin has been around longer than any other cryptocurrency and has not gone down or suffered any attacks (to the blockchain itself), so it has the longest proven history of being secure.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Bitcoin has the greatest number of users amongst all cryptocurrencies, giving it the largest network effects.
&gt; 
&gt; 7. Bitcoin has the largest amount of institutional adoption, which gives it much more legitimacy than other cryptos, as well as more use-cases involving larger transactions.

CointestAdmin,"#Bitcoin Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by debeezneez which won 1st place in the Bitcoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Once it is more widely accepted, Bitcoin will be the first complete currency human beings have ever had. Fiat doesn't have limited supply, gold doesn't have portability, proof of stake coins don't have durability. Bitcoin is only missing acceptability as a key component in a currency, and that is rapidly changing with increased adoption.
&gt; 
&gt; Even with a market cap of nearly 1 trillion dollars, bitcoin is extremely low in market cap compared to its potential. Some people expect that a sub billion dollar marketcap is the only way to make 100x, but that only relevant to coins that will top out in the billions. With the probable future of bitcoin being the worlds strongest currency, its value in TODAYS society is upwards of 100 trillion dollars (more on this later). In a future society that has had the benefit of using history's best monetary network, the potential market cap of bitcoin is indescribable.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite often being called 'slow' when compared to other crypto based networks, Bitcoins development is optimized. You don't need to have layer one staking or smart contracts to fulfill the purpose of bitcoin. All that needs to happen is flawless protocol defence and network uptime. The tech is simple but the importance is vast, replicate the factors of hard money in a digital space, forever. 
&gt; 
&gt; Doing so in a decentralized manner ensures that Bitcoin is strengthened with every blow. The network is so reliable that it pays more to support it than it does to attack it. So when China bans mining, America buys asiics. When someone tries to acquire all the coins, the price chases them up. There are no individuals to prosecute so you have to attack the network head on, and market participates are enticed to learn from each attack.
&gt; 
&gt; This is why regulation will hurt everything else but help the bitcoin network. No matter what the technology is or who uses it, if the government has a point of attack they will exploit it. Ethereum currently won't succeed without the vast changes being implemented by the ethereum foundation. That is a vulnerability. Fiat won't succeed without the federal government. That is a vulnerability. Bitcoin won't succeed if 51% of a largely spread group of financially successful people are somehow coerced to all betray themselves at the same time. That is not a serious vulnerability.
&gt; 
&gt; BUT HEY! You made a lot of assumptions!
&gt; What if Bitcoin doesn't become widely accepted?
&gt; Bitcoin is superior at all the other aspects of money. (Durability, Portability, Divisibility, Uniformity, Limited supply). People are going to want to own it and eventually want to spend some. If you don't accept it as payment but it is popular, your competition will.
&gt; 
&gt; How is 100 trillion even a real number?
&gt; There is more than just the money in everyones savings account. People already know that fiat can be outpaced with superior assets, and the equity market is estimated at around 300 trillion dollars today. None of those options have as many monetary aspects covered as bitcoin does.
&gt; 
&gt; Why would anyone new buy it if you can't yield farm shit coins?
&gt; Jokes aside, the purpose of bitcoin is to preserve purchasing power, which is does almost flawlessly. Everyone is going to want this ability for a large portion of their capital eventually. Other protocols are acting sort of like a bank when they run defi. Its really you lending your purchasing power to an actor for credit. Its pretty neat but not revolutionary just because its on blockchain. 
&gt; 
&gt; How is it decentralized when michael saylor owns it all?
&gt; Two part answer. The network is secured not just by holders but by nodes and miners. Microstrategy will get large returns for taking a large risk if bitcoins price goes up, and that is perfectly fair. But as they buy more and more, it is going to cost more and more, where every other financial system in history has had some sort of corruption in its growth from unequal opportunity. As of today and as of 10 years ago, you and apple have the same purchase price.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't hate on ETH, why can't something newer take Bitcoins place?
&gt; Other blockchain technologies are cool, and may create super awesome internet, banking and ownership applications. But none of these things could ever replace bitcoin without copying its protocol. Its set up just right for maintaining integrity over time as a currency. If ETH did so, it would just be bitcoin #2 with a lower market cap and thus less security. So other coins are not a threat at all to bitcoins future utilization/ceiling. They do take some of the speculative dollars away from bitcoin, which I think is why alts are more volatile in price.

Below is an argument written by Tritador which won 3rd place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; The problems with Ethereum do not need a lengthy explanation. Simply put, the technology is old and inefficient, and almost seems like it was designed more as a proof of concept than as a serious attempt to create a cryptocurrency network.
&gt; 
&gt; Ethereum is just plain bad at what it was designed to do. It is functional, and was the first crypto to introduce an amazing array of functionality to the crypto-universe. At the time, that was absolutely ground-breaking, and extremely important for the development of the crypto-universe.  But today, it is time for ETH to step aside for better crypto that was designed properly out of the gate, to do what ETH was intended to do the right way.
&gt; 
&gt; Ethereum was not designed for efficiency or scale. It was just designed to work. And it works. That is all it does.
&gt; 
&gt; The average investor has absolutely no practical use for a slow, congested crypto network that takes ages to accomplish basic actions and costs hundreds of dollars in gas fees to move tens of dollars of cryptocurrency around.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is why fewer and fewer people use Ethereum for its intended purpose. Ethereum has instead become an investment asset like bitcoin, but it takes a back seat to the far more established and well-known bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; There are other cryptocurrencies that do everything Ethereum was designed to do and more, and they do it better, faster, and cheaper, right out of the gate. Meanwhile, Ethereum is desperately being upgraded, trying to play catch up at the very game it invented.

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by jeff406 which won 3rd place in the Ethereum Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **It seems like the vast majority of arguments against Ethereum focus on one thing: gas fees. With several great sidechains/L2s in the greater Ethereum ecosystem, why is this still a problem?**
&gt; 
&gt; Regardless of how cheap transaction fees are on loopring, polygon, arbitrum, et cetera, most users will still be outpriced by the fees needed to bridge off L1 Ethereum in the first place. As more exchanges introduce the ability to withdraw directly to L2/sidechains, this issue will no longer be relevant. Until then, fiat onramps provide another easy way to avoid the high bridging fees.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, high L1 gas fees should serve as an intriguing indicator for the utility of the Ethereum network. These fees would not have become so exorbitant to begin with if it weren't for the excellent dApp opportunities in the Ethereum ecosystem. I have often seen this compared to the housing prices in NYC; yes, they are expensive, but that's because of the value you receive by having miners process your Ethereum transactions.
&gt; 
&gt; When there is no longer a need to manually bridge from L1, ETH is an obvious winner for investors big and small. The Ethereum ecosystem has a tremendous variety of dApps, large amounts of liquidity, and is home to some of the most valuable NFT collections. As blockchain technology improves and evolves, Ethereum will remain the centerpiece around which new scaffolding is built.

CointestAdmin,"#Moon Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by fan_of_hakiksexydays which won 1st place in the Moon Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Background:**
&gt; 
&gt; Moons are at the forefront of social media reward coins, using blockchain technology, to reward social media participation and content creators.
&gt; 
&gt; Steem was one of the earliest coins to reward social media content. But they did it backwards. It created a currency, then tried to create its own Reddit, hoping it would become popular. But they built it before gaining any traction as a social media tool. So it just became a blackhole for Steem fans, where everyone just talks about Steem, and hardly anyone outside of it would ever see it.
&gt; 
&gt; There are are more than one type of community points other than Moons. Bricks, Donuts, and the hip hop subreddit is adding its new coin. Moons are by far the more successful in this experiment.
&gt; 
&gt; # How have Moons fared so far:
&gt; 
&gt; In the months following Moons' introduction (June 2020), content creation and participation has increased along with most of the sub's metrics (amount of content created, amount of subscribers, amount of users logged in, # of comments on posts and daily, amount of karma generated).
&gt; 
&gt; The community picked up the pace on new subscribers, to become one of the fastest growing subreddit (many times in the top 5).
&gt; 
&gt; While it's hard to quantify quality of content, the sub has moved away form being heavily posts of links, to having more user generated content. Content that can sometimes be a brilliant in-depth analysis, or sometimes being fluff for moon farming.
&gt; 
&gt; But despite being into a bull market now, compared to the last bull market, things remain more civil and have fewer troll porblems than in 2017.
&gt; 
&gt; # Utility:
&gt; 
&gt; 1-**Governance.**
&gt; 
&gt; Governance allow users to have a voice in their community, and decide how Moons are run.
&gt; 
&gt; The nice thing about this, is if the community is having an issue with an aspect of Moons, it can be fixed.
&gt; 
&gt; If they want more utility, they can add it.
&gt; 
&gt; This allows for Moons to evolve, and remain functional.
&gt; 
&gt; It also gives users power, and in a way allows them to own a piece of the community. Giving more incentive to stay and build up that community.
&gt; 
&gt; 2-**Content reward.**
&gt; 
&gt; One of the big problems of social media, is rewarding content creators. You're often just rewarded with just views, likes, award icons, which are all just show pieces of no real value. Content creators are important for a site. Moons are solving this problem.
&gt; 
&gt; 3- **Participation incentive.**
&gt; 
&gt; It's not just creators who are rewarded, it's participants. Commenting and interacting with content is rewarded.
&gt; 
&gt; 4- **Mod incentive.**
&gt; 
&gt; And it's not just content creators and participants, it's also the mod team.
&gt; 
&gt; 5- **Tipping.**
&gt; 
&gt; Tipping takes the content and participation reward a step further, and allows more control for individual users on what to reward, and creating additional incentive. Along with being able to use this function for transactions, like tipping a service.
&gt; 
&gt; 6- **Games and contests.**
&gt; 
&gt; Contests create more interaction on a social media platform. Moons are already helping incentivize the prizes. There is also predictions and betting being experimented with.
&gt; 
&gt; 7- **Social media features.**
&gt; 
&gt; GIFs and premium badges are just the tip of the iceberg. Moons could be used to give more features to users, enhance appearances, and even give special access.
&gt; 
&gt; 8- **Marketplace.**
&gt; 
&gt; Goods and services could be exchanged on the platform using Moons. From the sub's own merchandise, to a marketplace between users. So you won't just be able to buy memberships and Reddit coins, but also many other things...like NFTs.
&gt; 
&gt; 9- **Banners.**
&gt; 
&gt; Moons can be used to buy banners on the sub. 
&gt; 
&gt; 10- **Engagement reward.**
&gt; 
&gt; Engagement is a key part in social media, and there's no reason Moons couldn't help reward engagement in the future, enhancing post engagement.
&gt; 
&gt; 11- **Expansion of other communities.**
&gt; 
&gt; As we are already seeing, Moons are expanding into other communities, like the memes sub, but are also creating new communities. Like moonjobs and onlymoons.
&gt; 
&gt; Even externally, there are sites like moonsswap and ccmoons created for it.
&gt; 
&gt; It's already beginning to grow into an ecosystem.
&gt; 
&gt; # Tokenomics
&gt; 
&gt; Max supply is at 250 million, but that will never actually be reached, because unclaimed Moons are permanently lost. It's estimated that there are 45 Million such moons so far.
&gt; 
&gt; While it may seem at first like a free airdrop distributed every month, should logically devalue a coin, there is actually a little more to this.
&gt; 
&gt; Moons require time and work to be acquired.
&gt; 
&gt; In the same way that free mining rewards don't completely devalue Bitcoin, because there was a cost of time and work put into getting those rewards.
&gt; 
&gt; Same way digging for precious metals increases their value, the harder it is to dig for them.
&gt; 
&gt; The more content or better content you need to get Moons, the more valuable they become.
&gt; 
&gt; Factors countering inflation:
&gt; 
&gt; **1- Increased difficulty-**
&gt; 
&gt; It's becoming increasingly difficult to get a big distribution, and a sizable proportion of karma when increasingly more people are also getting karma.
&gt; 
&gt; **2- Spread more thinly-**
&gt; 
&gt; The more people participate, the more thinly each distribution gets spread to more different hands.
&gt; 
&gt; If you divide a 1.3M moon distribution between 100 hands. They'll average 13,000 moons each. Meaning they're easy to get and not rare. 1 moon has less value because everyone is getting about 13,000 of them.
&gt; 
&gt; If you divide a 1.3M moon distribution between 30,000 hands. They'll average 43 Moons each. They become more competitive to get. And 1 moon becomes more valuable. The average person will only get about 43.
&gt; 
&gt; **3- Decrease in distribution-**
&gt; 
&gt; Each distribution is decreasing by 2.5%.
&gt; 
&gt; **4-** **Burning-**
&gt; 
&gt; 1,000 moons are burned every time someone purchases or renews the special membership.
&gt; 
&gt; **5- Usage-**
&gt; 
&gt; With the increased usage and utility of Moons, it will increase its value. You can already see it with users preferring to hang on to their Moons to keep their governance power. Rather than getting rid of their Moons.
&gt; 
&gt; # The tech
&gt; 
&gt; Moons are an ERC-20 token using Abritrum as its layer 2 solution.
&gt; 
&gt; This means Moons can take advantage of one the most powerful blockchains: Ethereum, along with its security. And at the same time have fast transactions and very low fees, thanks to Arbitrum.
&gt; 
&gt; This also mean Moons will share Arbitrum's strong scalability.
&gt; 
&gt; It's important to also note that Arbitrum offers better decentralization. It doesn't have centralized actors or bridges.
&gt; 
&gt; # Decentralization
&gt; 
&gt; While it's not a fully decentralized system, the governance is controlled by more than 50% of the users.
&gt; 
&gt; In fact, even whales and mods combined don't control 50% of the governance.
&gt; 
&gt; Mods actually only get 10% of the distribution. And have a minority vote. 53% is actually controlled by users who have 250-19,999 moons (aka lobsters-sharks).
&gt; 
&gt; # Social Media
&gt; 
&gt; Moons could have some serious implication as a social media tool, and solving social media problems.
&gt; 
&gt; It could solve the problem of content creator rewards.
&gt; 
&gt; Right now social media sites are struggling with that. They're relying on ads, and having to splatter more ads on content. And still not giving content creators their fair share.
&gt; 
&gt; While participation, engagement, and commenting isn't even rewarded.
&gt; 
&gt; It could also help improve a lot of the site features, with the help of a token.
&gt; 
&gt; This experiment could receive a lot of attention.
&gt; 
&gt; Where Steem has failed, because it started backwards, so far Moons have succeeded and have added 2 million new users, for a system that has remained functional, and is even handling the stress of a bull run better than in 2017.
&gt; 
&gt; # Conclusion
&gt; 
&gt; Moons are going through a trial by fire right now, with the huge influx of newcomers thanks to the bull market. And it's been staying strong. Not just in functionality, but also in price. It's surprising that all these new people aren't just selling all their moons.
&gt; 
&gt; People must be seeing some value.
&gt; 
&gt; Moons are still a work in progress, and definitely need more tweaking.
&gt; 
&gt; But that's the beauty of the governance, is that we can fix any issues we find with Moons.
&gt; 
&gt; And it's in the users' interest to make Moons functional and a successful experiment, and make the community work. And also potentially make them the answer to social media content and participation reward.
&gt; 
&gt; This experiment could be a future key to social media.

Loose_Screw_,"I see.

I more interpreted this to be a general debate about NFTs. The term fungible simply refers to the quality of being mutually interchangeable - no unit being different from another. There would still be NFTs in many private or hybrid blockchains, there would simply be more complex systems implemented around them. In essence and NFT is really just a classic database entity, where a fungible token is an entity with no associated fields.

These more complex systems built around NFTs could still potentially be built on existing chains like ethereum through the use of something like view-keys which exist on Monero, and other technologies and concepts.

If you're going to strictly interpret this as a conversation about NFTs in their most very basic form - basically just one time addresses representing a single asset where the sole possible transaction is transference then yes, that would be a very short conversation.",1664770229,iqufim1,CryptoCurrency,2022-10-03 4:10:29,1

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 2nd place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #Ethereum Con Argument 
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclosure: I currently hold a position in ETH, ~53% of my current portfolio value*
&gt; - Tweaking my argument from [the last round](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pz4vav/rcc_cointest_top_10_ethereum_conarguments_october/hq6gy23/) 
&gt; - ETH has been the subject of a lot of criticism over the years and the same points still seem to get recycled ([premine/founders](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owypvc/my_personal_investigation_into_ethereum_uncovers/), [DAO rollback](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao), [scalability/centralization](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qw2e32/eth_is_bad_and_i_am_tired_of_pretending_its_not/hl0bqo9/), [inflation/supply](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-ethereum)). There are a ton of rebuttals online for the most common Con arguments - [see here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/najp2c/addressing_common_criticisms_about_ethereum/) and [here](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) for a start. 
&gt; 
&gt; - That being said, there are definitely some legitimate concerns about ETH to consider: 
&gt; 
&gt; ##Gotta pay the troll toll
&gt; 
&gt; - As a protocol, Ethereum is an '[empire](https://www.finder.com.au\/brave-new-worlds-cosmos-blockchain-and-social-evolution)', a self-contained ecosystem with [composability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- But the downside of a 'one chain to rule them all' approach is that it locks users into using the system and paying gas fees in ETH. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) is certainly an industry standard, but [interoperability](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/why-is-interoperability-important-for-blockchain) may be crypto's future. As Do Kwon of LUNA said recently: ""[Maybe it's a bad idea to stick all the applications into one global computer. Maybe it just makes sense to have a multi-chain future.](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1439969124550119431)"" Vitalik agrees, [but differentiates between a *multi-chain* vs. a *cross-chain* future](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/).
&gt; 
&gt; - We all know [gas fees](https://www.gasprice.io/) on ETH are a pain in the ass. 
&gt;     -  A lot of complaints about gas are misguided or uninformed, not understanding the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition), mistakenly believing EIP1559 was supposed to lower gas fees (vs. [making them more predictable](https://pintail.xyz/posts/gas-market-analysis/)), or suggesting that ['gas fees are high, no one will use Ethereum'](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qikr7r/a_10k_eth_is_not_unrealistic_it_is_inevitable/hik9pet/). 
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High gas fees are in fact an indication of usage, of [people competing to use the chain](https://cryptofees.info/) - but this makes ETH a victim of its own success.
&gt; 
&gt; - Paying [$20 for a token transfer or a Uniswap trade](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) is just not feasible for users with less capital - [they get priced out of using the chain](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdi9i8/ive_tried_to_use_ethereum_1015_times_over_the/).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- A really interesting article dives deeper into how ""[people are entirely 'locked out' of their funds since it‚Äôd cost more in transaction fees to move the funds than the funds are actually worth.](https://medium.com/geekculture/value-fragmentation-8c8336f97cfd)"" At the time of writing the total 'lost value' of ERC20s was $600M, which doesn't include ETH itself or NFTs. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Which brings us to competition and scalability:
&gt; 
&gt; ##I drink your milkshake
&gt; 
&gt; - Having prioritized decentralization and security at the expense of scalability, Ethereum is now [focused on rollups to meet demand](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html).
&gt; 
&gt; -  However, some users may not care about decentralization - they want to participate in DeFi, NFTs, etc. without paying an arm and a leg and will use BSC, SOL or [sidechains that don't inherit ETH's security](https://finematics.com/polygon-commit-chain-explained/).
&gt; 	- [Funds have migrated](https://ethhole.link/) over the past year from ETH [via bridges to L2s and other L1s](https://medium.com/etherscan-blog/ethereum-bridges-four-months-on-10ee36f889ae).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- [TVL on L2s has boomed](https://l2beat.com/) as users flock to platforms with [cheaper transactions](https://l2fees.info/). Polygon for instance recently [flipped Ethereum in daily active addresses](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/04/polygon-flips-ethereum-on-active-user-addresses/).
&gt; 
&gt; - Ryan Selkis of Messari explained some concerns around these trends, suggesting that ETH's position will eroded by competitors and/or cannibalized by L2s:
&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt;[""Decentralization (specifically political decentralization) and architectural soundness have become secondary properties at best and willfully ignored at worst in the mercenary dominant market of 2021. Not every new chain has tossed decentralization aside, but many have. Even if Ethereum manages to hold off its largest non-EVM rivals, it will leak value to the rollup chains it leans on for scalability. ETH sits at ~60% market cap dominance among Layer 1s. That will either fall below 50% in 2022, or its Layer 2 rollup tokens will eat into its growth. Maybe both.] (https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf)""
&gt; 
&gt; ##Points of failure?
&gt; 
&gt; - While I agree with [this article debunking the ""ETH is centralized"" mantra](https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-isnt-decentralized-and-other-myths-ef2d132ee1fe), I think Ethereum still has some progress to make on the [**sociopolitical** and **architectural** aspects of decentralization](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274#.355j5eg0v):
&gt; 
&gt; - **Sociopolitics**:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- Vitalik is a great steward of the project and has been [trying to remove himself as a single point of failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x1b_S6Qp2Q&amp;t=656s). Anyone remember the [Vitalik death hoax?](https://fortune.com/2017/06/26/vitalik-death/)
&gt; 
&gt;         - But as a 'high priest', Vitalik's [vision](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html), [proposals](https://news.coincu.com/38718-vitalik-buterin-makes-proposal-eip-4488-to-lower-gas-fees-for-ethereum-layer-2-in-the-short-term/) and opinions have preeminent influence and there's no doubt [he remains the 'face' of Ethereum](https://time.com/6158182/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-profile/). The community looks to him for key communications like [roadmap updates](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1466411377107558402).
&gt; 
&gt;         * While [Ethereum development functions as an open source collaboration](https://media.consensys.net/ethereum-2-0s-latest-strides-forward-13f63652e57d?gi=30830fb85bbd), I think there are a lot of benefits to having a pseudonymous, 'absent' founder like with Bitcoin and Monero. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - There are also some concerns in my mind about the role of Joe Lubin and ConsenSys in [privatizing what should arguably be public goods](https://saitoofficial.medium.com/the-infura-problem-fe68866484ec). 
&gt; 
&gt; - **Architecture**: 
&gt; 
&gt;     * ConsenSys has been a huge player in [driving enterprise adoption](https://consensys.net/blog/news/consensys-acquires-jpm-quorum/) - but they also own [key Ethereum infrastructure like Infura and MetaMask](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/02/consensys-shareholders-readying-legal-action-over-share-valuation/). They're now being [audited for letting banks like JPMorgan Chase get a piece of the pie](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blockchain-company-consensys-faces-multi-billion-dollar-audit-as-shareholders-claim-board-breaches-fiduciary-duties---attributed-to-arthur-falls-301493433.html).
&gt; 
&gt;      - [Crypto Twitter](https://twitter.com/infura_io/status/1499446959827931175) seemed surprised to learn that MetaMask and Infura aren't actually permissionless [when users in some countries lost access](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/136336/a-look-at-metamask-infura-opensea-and-the-countries-they-do-not-serve).
&gt; 
&gt;      - Bigger incidents like [Infura going down](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereums-infura-iating-outage-revives-decentralization-concerns) or the [Geth bug causing a chain split](https://decrypt.co/79597/ethereum-blockchain-splits-software-bug-network) highlight the Ethereum network's reliance on this infrastructure. 
&gt; 
&gt; 		
&gt;     - Meanwhile client and hosting diversity remains an issue [(1)](https://mirror.xyz/jmcook.eth/S7ONEka_0RgtKTZ3-dakPmAHQNPvuj15nh0YGKPFriA) [(2)](https://clientdiversity.org/) as of writing:
&gt; 
&gt;         - On the mainnet (PoW): [&gt;80% of nodes use Geth](https://www.ethernodes.org/), while [~69% of nodes run on hosting services](https://www.ethernodes.org/network-types)([e.g. AWS](https://decrypt.co/44321/70-of-ethereum-nodes-are-hosted-on-centralized-services)).
&gt; 
&gt;         - On the beacon chain (PoS): ~2/3 of validators use Pr...

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by bkcrypt0 which won 2nd place in the Ethereum Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Ethereum is the Microsoft of Blockchains -- nobody really likes to use it, but it's just too big and established to fail.
&gt; 
&gt; There is something to first mover advantage in tech revolutions. The companies that establish themselves early as a platform, become the de facto standard. Ethereum is that standard, despite the high fees and congestion.
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Their developer network is well established with teams building on the platform at an incredible rate.
&gt; 
&gt; 2.  Ethereum has captured most of the big use cases for crypto, and the number of ERC-20 tokens reflect that. 
&gt; - The top 20 defi projects by total value locked are all ERC-20 compliant (https://defipulse.com/)
&gt; - The biggest NFT platform (Opensea) ‚Äî built for Ethereum. The highest amount of money paid for NFTs ‚Äî again, ETH. 
&gt; 
&gt; 3. The technology is slow, but solid. Nodes are decentralized. There‚Äôs little to no downtime. The roadmap is clear to shift to proof-of-stake and eventually sharding that will lighten the main chain processing load. 
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Owners of ETH are voting with their tokens wit a high percentage of circulating supply locked in staking. That‚Äôs an enormous vote of confidence in the tech and platform.

There are also many different crypto projects dedicated to various niches. Ethereum for example acts as a mothership of sorts for many different crypto projects. It's possible to create projects on the ethereum chain (i.e NFTs, Coins, Dexs, etc) by using a coding language called Solidity which in turn creates smart contracts

What do you think about this project after Cronje left? I was very happy with the TVL increase in 2021 and at the beginning of 2022, but it dropped 50% after Cronje left (it may be a coincidence though).

&gt; Which projects do you think, are the real use of what crypto is ment for?

Crypto is meant for many things and there are many (FTM included) with real use cases. Since you've mentioned online payments, I believe Binance and Utrust are good examples. 

I'm also holding Oracles (Band protocol, Chainlink and Dia) and I believe they fulfill the ""real use case"" definition, since they are essential to the defi industry.

CointestAdmin,"#Bitcoin Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by debeezneez which won 1st place in the Bitcoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Once it is more widely accepted, Bitcoin will be the first complete currency human beings have ever had. Fiat doesn't have limited supply, gold doesn't have portability, proof of stake coins don't have durability. Bitcoin is only missing acceptability as a key component in a currency, and that is rapidly changing with increased adoption.
&gt; 
&gt; Even with a market cap of nearly 1 trillion dollars, bitcoin is extremely low in market cap compared to its potential. Some people expect that a sub billion dollar marketcap is the only way to make 100x, but that only relevant to coins that will top out in the billions. With the probable future of bitcoin being the worlds strongest currency, its value in TODAYS society is upwards of 100 trillion dollars (more on this later). In a future society that has had the benefit of using history's best monetary network, the potential market cap of bitcoin is indescribable.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite often being called 'slow' when compared to other crypto based networks, Bitcoins development is optimized. You don't need to have layer one staking or smart contracts to fulfill the purpose of bitcoin. All that needs to happen is flawless protocol defence and network uptime. The tech is simple but the importance is vast, replicate the factors of hard money in a digital space, forever. 
&gt; 
&gt; Doing so in a decentralized manner ensures that Bitcoin is strengthened with every blow. The network is so reliable that it pays more to support it than it does to attack it. So when China bans mining, America buys asiics. When someone tries to acquire all the coins, the price chases them up. There are no individuals to prosecute so you have to attack the network head on, and market participates are enticed to learn from each attack.
&gt; 
&gt; This is why regulation will hurt everything else but help the bitcoin network. No matter what the technology is or who uses it, if the government has a point of attack they will exploit it. Ethereum currently won't succeed without the vast changes being implemented by the ethereum foundation. That is a vulnerability. Fiat won't succeed without the federal government. That is a vulnerability. Bitcoin won't succeed if 51% of a largely spread group of financially successful people are somehow coerced to all betray themselves at the same time. That is not a serious vulnerability.
&gt; 
&gt; BUT HEY! You made a lot of assumptions!
&gt; What if Bitcoin doesn't become widely accepted?
&gt; Bitcoin is superior at all the other aspects of money. (Durability, Portability, Divisibility, Uniformity, Limited supply). People are going to want to own it and eventually want to spend some. If you don't accept it as payment but it is popular, your competition will.
&gt; 
&gt; How is 100 trillion even a real number?
&gt; There is more than just the money in everyones savings account. People already know that fiat can be outpaced with superior assets, and the equity market is estimated at around 300 trillion dollars today. None of those options have as many monetary aspects covered as bitcoin does.
&gt; 
&gt; Why would anyone new buy it if you can't yield farm shit coins?
&gt; Jokes aside, the purpose of bitcoin is to preserve purchasing power, which is does almost flawlessly. Everyone is going to want this ability for a large portion of their capital eventually. Other protocols are acting sort of like a bank when they run defi. Its really you lending your purchasing power to an actor for credit. Its pretty neat but not revolutionary just because its on blockchain. 
&gt; 
&gt; How is it decentralized when michael saylor owns it all?
&gt; Two part answer. The network is secured not just by holders but by nodes and miners. Microstrategy will get large returns for taking a large risk if bitcoins price goes up, and that is perfectly fair. But as they buy more and more, it is going to cost more and more, where every other financial system in history has had some sort of corruption in its growth from unequal opportunity. As of today and as of 10 years ago, you and apple have the same purchase price.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't hate on ETH, why can't something newer take Bitcoins place?
&gt; Other blockchain technologies are cool, and may create super awesome internet, banking and ownership applications. But none of these things could ever replace bitcoin without copying its protocol. Its set up just right for maintaining integrity over time as a currency. If ETH did so, it would just be bitcoin #2 with a lower market cap and thus less security. So other coins are not a threat at all to bitcoins future utilization/ceiling. They do take some of the speculative dollars away from bitcoin, which I think is why alts are more volatile in price.

CointestAdmin,"#Polkadot Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by madpanda94 which won 2nd place in the Polkadot Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; This analysis come from a post from 1 month ago written by me [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pl5ggp/knowyourcrypto\_9\_september\_9\_2021\_polkadot\_dot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pl5ggp/knowyourcrypto_9_september_9_2021_polkadot_dot/)
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; # What is it?
&gt; 
&gt; Polkadot is a scalable blockchain, which guarantees interoperability between different networks as well as a secure protocol for connecting different chains. It is a Web3 project, which aims to develop IT infrastructures for a decentralized web, at the center of which, together with other projects, will be Polkadot. We are facing a monumental project, with very ambitious objectives and which also aims to offer an important basis for the development of autonomous and collateral projects. Without going into overly technical concepts, the goal of scalability translates into the ability to host more and more projects, ensure greater connectivity without increasing consumption and costs and without slowdowns. Polkadot scalability is one of the main features of DOT network, but it's not the only one. Talking about the concept of interconnetcion between blockchains, there are actually several projects that offer IT infrastructures for connecting blockchains that otherwise couldn't talk to each other. The peculiarity of Polkadot lies in offering interfaces that also allow the transmission of raw data, that is, non-tokenized data. This can be extremely important for data useful for triggering a smart contract, which comes for example from exchanges or other types of data centers. Polkadot network doesn't need hardforks too. In order to implement significant innovations within the project, older generation blockchain projects had to split to continue on the project. This is a slow process, expensive in terms of resources and often confusing. Polkadot (DOT), on the other hand, is a project that allows for the implementation of innovations in the running, or rather in production, without the need to split the tree and leave another as abandoned. A structure of this type, which today is actually common to many and different blockchains, makes Polkadot much more useful in case you want to implement the innovations that the market requires. It is important to talk about the founders who animate the project too. Among these is Gavin Wood, whom the most passionate about cryptocurrencies will remember being one of the founders of Ethereum. An important figure within the cryptocurrency community and inventor of the Proof of Authority and Whisper protocols.
  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; # How does it work?
&gt; 
&gt; Before being a cryptocurrency (DOT), Polkadot is one if the latest generation blockchain protocol, which has the main purpose of allowing interconnection between different chains, internal or external to the project. There are several characteristics that we could define as unique to the project:
  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; * **Scalability**: Classic blockchains can only perform a finite number of operations and can quickly become too expensive in terms of transaction costs or slow in processing information. Polkadot instead has a shared multichain design, which means that it can process information and transactions by relying on different blockchains in parallel. This allows to eliminate at the root the phenomena of bottlenecks - which are one of the main problems of the old generation blockchains - and to be able to have infinite scalability on paper.
  
&gt; 
&gt; * **Flexibility**: Another typical problem with older generation blockchains is that they are highly incapable of adapting to uses other than those for which they were intended. In Polkadot, on the other hand, flexibility is by design. Parachains can be developed, which means they can operate according to their own rules and adapt to the needs of the project. This puts enormous potential in the hands of developers, which allows the creation of projects that other types of systems would never have allowed. Allowing sovereignty to internal projects makes Polkadot crucial within the new wave of decentralized finance. That is, systems that aim to offer bank-like services on the blockchain. Those who are comfortable with the terms borrowed from computer science, could imagine Polkadot's parachain and general rules as libraries that can be easily inserted into their projects.
  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Sharing of information and features**: Just as if they were software that share the same operating system. One of the most important things that can be shared are transaction validations. Those who want to develop their own distributed App, can rely on the entire network that we have just described, behind payments in DOT. The crucial importance of DOT is connected, but it is a concept that we will express in greater detail below, to the use that is made of the platform.
  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; # Where to store it?
&gt; 
&gt; The best hot wallets for Polkadot are Polkawallet, Polkadot.js, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 1st place in the Polkadot Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/shippior's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; Polkadot was founded by Gavin Wood, one of the main developers of the early Ethereum platform. Gavin left Etheruem to set up Polkadot in his vision of what Ethereum should be, but cannot be. The main set-up for Polkadot was to do the things Ethereum does better:
&gt; 
&gt; *Solve the scalability problem faster than Ethereum 2.0
&gt; 
&gt; *Parachains shall provide more freedom than shards
&gt; 
&gt; *Minimal, simple, general, robust
&gt; 
&gt; To solve the scalability problem for starters the blockchain was created using a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus method. 
&gt; 
&gt; Instead of shards, which we know from the Ethereum network, Polkadot aims to implement it's own version called Parachains which are full functioning blockchains. This means they can have their own set of functions, they might not even have smart contracts or have different interpreters running these contracts than the main blockchain. This means Polkadot is able to scale into a heterogenous multi-chain.
&gt; 
&gt; Because it allows parachains to create it's own functionality however it wants the Polkadot main chain can be kept without much functionality (even without smart contracts) and thereby stay simple and robust. Keeping it simple also helps with the security, the main functionality that the Polkadot mainchain provides for all the parachains.
&gt; 
&gt; The other major function of the Polkadot chain is to allow parachains to communicate with eachother. In Polkadot it is not necessary wait for all validators to reach consensus on a block, if there are enough votes, the block can become valid, but later there can still be a validator voting this block as invalid, even though the 2/3 majority was already given. This is required to process all the communication between the parachains efficient and fast.
&gt; 
&gt; Now one might think that due to the limited slots (there are only 100 slots available) for parachains that there can only be finite functionality in the whole of the Polkadot network. But there is no limit for Parachains to become parachains themselves, and those parachains to become parachains as well, making the number of parachains that can connect to the Polkadot network infinite.

Below is an argument written by idevcg which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; 1. Bitcoin has the highest liquidity of all crypto currencies.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Bitcoin has ""immaculate conception""; it was completely fairly launched with no 'pre-mine"". Furthermore, there were no VCs or other big players who just went in and bought huge amounts at the start. Anyone could have gotten in, and this is no longer replicable by any new cryptocurrencies even if they try to make a fair launch.
&gt; 
&gt; 3. It is by far the most decentralized cryptocurrency in existence. It's founder is not only still anonymous, but he is no longer working on the project. Bitcoin is the only coin with a sizeable following that is no longer controlled or heavily influenced by a founder(s), which is a potential attack vector for malicious actors.
&gt; 
&gt; 4. PoW is more secure than PoS, and the Bitcoin blockchain is by far the most secure PoW network (especially after Ethereum moves to PoS) with the greatest hashing requirements.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. Bitcoin has been around longer than any other cryptocurrency and has not gone down or suffered any attacks (to the blockchain itself), so it has the longest proven history of being secure.
&gt; 
&gt; 6. Bitcoin has the greatest number of users amongst all cryptocurrencies, giving it the largest network effects.
&gt; 
&gt; 7. Bitcoin has the largest amount of institutional adoption, which gives it much more legitimacy than other cryptos, as well as more use-cases involving larger transactions.

Below is an argument written by madpanda94 which won 3rd place in the USDC Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; My analysis comes from a post from 1 month ago written by me [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pkita5/knowyourcrypto\_8\_september\_8\_2021\_usd\_coin\_usdc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pkita5/knowyourcrypto_8_september_8_2021_usd_coin_usdc/)
&gt; 
&gt; # What is it?
&gt; 
&gt; USD Coin is a stable coin, which is a cryptocurrency that has the same value as a classic currency, in this case the US dollar. It is a similar project, in several ways, to other stable coins. It is also the stable coin managed directly by the Coinbase and Coinbase PRO exchanges, one of the most important exchanges in the world. USD Coin, as it should be more than clear from the name, is pegged to the dollar. What does this mean? It means that the value of a USDC token will always be equal to the value of one dollar. We will always be able to convert (we will see the special cases later) a token of this type into dollars. As we can then see on the main markets that change it, the price can fluctuate very slightly with respect to that of the dollar, generally in the order of thousandths of a percentage. These are very small variations that are mostly dependent on the small inefficiencies that can be created on the market. Perhaps one of the best qualities of USDC is that it is controlled by a consortium, in which partecipate several players in the cryptocurrency industry. It was in fact founded by Circle, and today also hosts the popular Coinbase exchange, and the mining company Bitmain, which is one of the largest investors in Circle. An internal project? No. A project that today has behind it the most serious groups circulating in the world of cryptocurrencies.
  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; # How does it work?
&gt; 
&gt; Like all stable coins, USD Coin also has as its main use to act as a counter value on high-frequency exchanges, obviously being tokenized. Therefore, its first use is to act as a counterparty in the negotiations that take place within the main exchanges. Coinbase aims to use it as a means of payment, offering free wallets and above all the possibility for everyone to exchange a crypto with a stable value expressed in dollars without the delays and costs that are instead connected to classic banking. USD Coin is a ERC-20 token, which is a token that is compatible with the Ethereum blockchain. A choice of this type has proved to be a winning one over time because the Ethereum network today offers reliability and allows this stable token, USDC, to be used in many decentralized finance projects. USDC is not mined, that means it is not created by solving very complicated algorithmic calculations. In fact this product is issued on demand. Anyone who buys USDC from Coinbase will have new ones delivered and never released. The doubt in this case is that Coinbase, as well as the other agents involved in the project, can issue more money than they will actually be able to convert one day. This problem can be overcome, provided that the exchange actually has US dollars or equivalent in cash.
  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; # Where to store it?
&gt; 
&gt; The best hot wallets for USD Coin are Coinbase Wallet, TrustWallet and Atomic Wallet. If you want more security, a cold storage like Ledger or Trezor is the right choice.

Below is an argument written by ExchangeEnough7821 which won 2nd place in the USDC Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; What is USD coin?
&gt; 
&gt; USD coin is a stablecoin, first announced in May 2018. It is developed by the Circle Consortium - a partnership between the company Circle and the exchange Coinbase. Circle and Coinbase are responsible for issuing the USD coin, and Centre develops the technology behind and the framework of it. Circle is a company founded in 2013 by Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville, and is an official Money Transmitter ‚Äì it must comply with federal law and regulations. Now, it has over 60 partners and is continuing to expand.
&gt; 
&gt; Uses of USD coin:
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Avoid inflation in countries with weak economies
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Send money around the world without large fees, securely and instantly
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Short other coins without having to convert to fiat
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Buys things in crypto based apps and websites
&gt; 
&gt; Pros of USD coin:
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	USD coin has many high value and reliable partneships with large firms, that gives the project stability and credibility. These include Goldman Sachs, Bitmain and IDG Capital, and these high profile links mean USD coin can be seen as trustworthy
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Transfers with USD coin only take roughly 15 seconds, compared to the minutes it takes for a fiat wire transfer or similar ‚Äì this means it has a use case in transferring money across the globe quickly
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	The cost of money transfers remains the same no matter the size ‚Äì it is the Ethereum gas fee-, and this means for high value transfers it can be cheaper than other fiat versions, which may take a percentage
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	 Compared to the US Dollar, you can earn a much higher interest on the coin with decentralised apps, so is more profitable when holding than fiat currency.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	It is backed 1 to 1 with the US dollar ‚Äì one of the strongest and most reliable currencies in the world, so is also a very reliable stablecoin.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	USD coin can be used by those who don‚Äôt have access to traditional bank account due to age or location, so can still cash out other coins into an exchange

CointestAdmin,"#Cardano Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Maleficent_Plankton which won 1st place in the Cardano Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; ###**Background**
&gt; 
&gt; It has been half a year for Cardano ever since the Alonzo (smart contract) release, which revealed that it's very difficult to build a DEX for eUXTO transactions instead of account transactions. Even after the release of SundaeSwap and MinSwap, we've seen issues for DEX development. I'm still following the Cardano subreddit, and I think it's better now since its members are much less cultish/bullish than before.
&gt; 
&gt; On the [Cardano development roadmap](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/), there's only scaling (Basho) and governance (Voltaire) left, and Cardano's followers are much less excited about those updates as they were for the smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; ###**Cardano Cons**
&gt; 
&gt; **Current state of Cardano Smart Contracts and DEXs**: 
&gt; 
&gt; - **Programming adoption**: For Cardano's Plutus smart contract, Haskell is not a well-liked programming language and feels arcane in comparison the Javascript-like language of Ethereum's Solidity. It's been difficult to onboard smart contract developers, especially since Ethereum is already so far ahead on adoption. And most other smart contract networks also support Solidity. Cardano is alone on Haskell, making it expensive to develop for it.
&gt; * **DEX rollout** in the past 6 months was an absolute mess. Concurrency failures for the Minswap Dex during their Alonzo smart contract test revealed that it's much harder to develop a DEX on Cardano smart contracts due to the limitation of eUXTOs. Back in September, SundaeSwap published [a detailed explanation of the concurrency issues](https://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/concurrency-state-cardano-c160f8c07575) plaguing Cardano. Proposed solutions involved centralization of the smart contract and using multiple UXTOs on a higher layer that would later settle on Layer 1.
&gt; * **SundaeSwap** finally released [an incomplete and slightly-buggy DEX](https://cryptobriefing.com/sundaeswap-promises-first-functional-dex-on-cardano/) on the testnet after many months of delays. It had [extremely slow speeds on SundaeSwap](https://beincrypto.com/cardanos-first-dex-sundaeswap-fails-to-impress-on-launch/) with a limit of only [9 users operations per minute per scooper](https://sundaeswap-finance.medium.com/expectations-congestion-mainnet-launch-e9da5abfd819). Their reputation was hurt badly after the [Cardstarter scandal](https://cardanofeed.com/cardstarter-and-sundaeswap-a-falling-out-story-42690.html) where SundaeSwap cheated their Cardstarter partner of initial rewards, in addition to rumors of front-running.
&gt; * **MinSwap** has now [doubled SundaeSwap in total locked value](https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano) in only 3 weeks, but even this DEX only sees a couple of million USD worth of swaps daily. No other Cardano DEX even come close in size. Compare this to a whopping [$1.2 billion daily volume for Ethereum network's Uniswap](https://coinranking.com/exchanges). In their defense, it's only been 1-2 months, so it could just take time to grow. Another downside is that neither of these exchanges natively support the most popular Cardano wallet, Yoroi. Instead, you have to install specialized extensions to use these DEXs due to DEX design complexities.
&gt; 
&gt; **Scaling issues**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Transaction speed**: ADA's current maximum transaction speed is about 8 TPS, which can [scale to 257 TPS](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-deep-dive-into-cardano) without additional updates. While this was fine before the Alonso update, after the release of smart contracts, the network has become very congested. Top scaling is 1000 TPS without Hydra Layer 2 scaling. This is still nowhere near the limits needed for global adoption on Layer 1. Many of its competitors like Solana, Polygon, Algorand, and Terra, have surpassed its TPS.
&gt; * **Scaling** via Hydra and sharding is far away on their timeline (Basho update maybe Q2 2022 if there are no further delays). Hydra also uses multi-party state channels, which are not as simple or convenient to use as Layer 1. We still have scant information of the protocol on a detailed level.
&gt; * **Storage inefficiency**: Cardano: [12.26M transactions in 10.76 GB](https://blockchair.com/cardano) = 880 bytes / transaction. Ethereum: [1.27B transactions in 279 GB](https://blockchair.com/ethereum) = 218 bytes / transaction. Ethereum is 4x more storage-efficient even before Cardano releases smart contracts. If Cardano were to scale to 1000 TPS, it would increase its blocksize by at least 30 TB per year.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Competitors**
&gt; 
&gt; * Cardano's development has been extremely slow and delayed so much that its competitors have caught up: Cardano has fallen from #3 in market cap to #6 last year after Solana passed it, and it has further fallen to #8. There are so many (monolithic Layer 1) Ethereum competitors that can already do smart contracts with DEXs more efficiently with higher scalability than Cardano: Polygon, Terra, Algorand, Elrond. The academic researcher crowd that Cardano was targeting has moved onto supporting Algorand. Even if Cardano releases a working DEX, they're technologically-behind their competitors.
&gt; 
&gt; **Fees**:
&gt; 
&gt; * Cardano Transactions [fees](https://messari.io/asset/cardano/chart/txn-fee-avg) are currently about $0.40 - 0.50 USD as of Mar 2022. While these are cheaper than current Bitcoin network transaction fees of ~2-4 USD and much cheaper than Ethereum network transaction fees of 2-20+ USD, they're way more expensive than those of other many other competing crypto networks. Nano, ALGO, XLM, XRP, DASH, BCH, and MATIC fees are all below $0.01 on average, which makes them appropriate for microtransactions.
&gt; * Swap fees on MinSwap and SundaeSwap are way cheaper than on Ethereum, but still expensive at $2+ due to processing fees.
&gt; 
&gt; **Diminishing Staking Rewards in the long run**:
&gt; 
&gt; * Cardano is currently inflationary to about [5-6% annually](https://solberginvest.com/blog/is-cardano-deflationary/). The inflation by itself isn't bad, but it's coming from a diminishing rewards pool that will gradually disappear by 2030. In just 4 years from now, the staking reward will drop to 2-3% unless transaction fees rise drastically to replace the rewards pool. If it drops that low, people will stop staking Cardano, leading to less security and decentralization.
&gt; 
&gt; Disclosure: I own a tiny bit of ADA.

CointestAdmin,"#Cardano Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by TNGSystems which won 2nd place in the Cardano Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; I'll preface this by stating I'm no expert on Cardano, but I understand what I consider its core concepts are and how this differs from other Cryptocurrencies.  
&gt; 
&gt; #1.  Tenets of Cryptocurrency  
&gt; 
&gt; I think Cardano is one of the only top 20 Cryptocurrencies besides Ethereum and Bitcoin that adhere to the original vision of Cryptocurrency. Whilst technologies are expected to change over time, something that should remain steadfast are the tenets of Cryptocurrency;  
&gt; 
&gt; * Decentralisation
&gt; * Security
&gt; * User-controlled
&gt; * Beneficial  
&gt; 
&gt; Cardano ticks these boxes with aplomb. There are currently over 3,100 independent worldwide staking pools at time of writing, these pools are now producing 100% of the blocks and have no official affiliation with IOHK. With these pools, 998,000 delegators are staking their ADA to secure the network, across the globe. These delegators enjoy a 4-7% ROI.  
&gt; 
&gt; Cardano remains the only major platform Cryptocurrency to not fall victim to an attack or breach. Ethereum has suffered a roll-back (Creating Ethereum Classic), Solana has had several faults that resulted in network outages. Avalanche has also been stopped. Algorand's Dex has been breached and several million dollars have been stolen.  
&gt; 
&gt; Once the Voltaire phase is completed, all IOHK fully steps back and gives the whole Cardano platform to the delegators and stake pool operators. Decisions and future development are voted on in a fully decentralised manner.  
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, Cardano is actually beneficial. It has a goal and a usable roadmap. It doesn't jump on the latest trend to capitalise and draw in new investors. It knows what it wants to do - create the best 3rd generation Cryptocurrency platform and start off with African adoption.  
&gt; 
&gt; #2.  Methodology  
&gt; 
&gt; One of the biggest detracting statements to Cardano is that it refuses to ""Move fast and break things"" by that, it means that other Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum prefer to build fast and fix problems along the way. Now that is fine for certain applications, but in the world of financial security it's not an ideal trait. ""We will fix it when it goes wrong"" isn't acceptable when there's literally Billions of dollars on the line. It's fine when you have a large spread of users plopping $20 to use a bit of DeFi, but companies will be rightfully skeptical of adopting these systems that have such large potentials for failure.  
&gt; 
&gt; This is where one of Cardano's chief strengths lie - Its is built using a formal verification. Many think this is just a bunch of boffins passing code around and going ""Yep, it looks good to me!"", but in reality, Cardano's is mathematically proven to do what it says it does. When the code is formally verified and peer reviewed it is then deployed in rigorous testnets before final deployment. So while other projects move fast and break things, Cardano does what it says and as a result I believe it to be more attractive to the institutions it should be used for.
&gt; 
&gt; #3.  Alternative Technology  
&gt; 
&gt; The sum of the argument here is that Cardano uses the Extended Unspent Transaction Output model whereas Ethereum and many other Cryptos use the Accounts-based model. Cardano's model is extended, as it combines Bitcoin's UTXO model with some of the capabilities Ethereum pioneered. The fundamental difference is that with eUTXO, the user experience is significantly better. Cardano can tell when a users balance is sufficient to cover the transaction + fee, and reject transactions that do not have sufficient funds. While this doesn't seem significant, remember that on Ethereum's Accounts based model, **plus** the large fees, users can be unexpected hit with significant fees and have their funds locked due to insufficient gas, with failed transactions costing these users money.  
&gt; 
&gt; Another huge advantage is that the eUTXO model allows L2 solutions to interface with the blockchain better. While L2's for Ethereum are fast and cheap to use, they don't interface well with the blockchain and users are required to spend resources and time to move their Crypto from L1 to L2, and then back again. This is a complication of the Accounts-based model where there can only be one ledger per layer, and Smart Contracts can only run on one ledger or the other. With the eUTXO model, a smart contract can run on both and this will offer significant advantages when Hydra is launched.   
&gt; 
&gt; ---
&gt; 
&gt; The TL;DR here is that the things Cardano fans have been shouting about since the start *are a big deal*. We have a dedication to uphold the tenets of Cryptocurrency, when big players like Solana and Avalanche seem to consider it secondary. The methodology produces immutable and secure results, which is attractive to businesses, institutions and government bodies. And the technology behind it is built taking the best components of Bitcoin and Ethereum. **Thanks for reading!**

Kumomax1911,"**My experience from Bitcoin's early days (Starting around 2011 I think):**
  

  
I had to buy my first bitcoin through a weird game called Second Life. It had virtual Bitcoin ATM machines at the time. I mean a real virtual ATM machine that you needed to walk your in game character up to. This was maybe around 2011? The virtual ATM machine accepted the game's currency called Liden dollars, and then would spit out Bitcoin in return. However, the only way I could figure out how to easily acquire these Liden dollars was through a weird exchange called virwox.com. It's hard to remember, but I think the Bitcoin USD price around this period was somewhere between $2.00-$9.00. Most of these purchases were used for ""various activities"" that required Bitcoin, but I did save a personal stash. I believe I transacted around 1,400 Bitcoin in total around this time, but only withdrew a personal holding bag with \~100 Bitcoin. Funny, enough, I'm pretty certain Virwox.com was left with some change on my final transaction. I'm assuming around 1 Bitcoin. I completely forgot about this until after they shut down, and I've since heard they ate it up my remaining balance with inactivity fees (Talk about the worlds largest inactivity fees).
  

  
Anyway, this personal bag of 100 Bitcoin was withdrawn to an original Bitcoin core wallet and that wallet key was saved as a wallet.dat file on my junk Dell laptop. That tiny file was then emailed to myself as an attachment and it lived out it's life for a pretty long while in my insecure email protected by a insecure password. It wasn't until Bitcoin reached over $1200 and then crashed back to a couple hundred dollars that the majority of this bag was sold off. This was one of the crashes where the ignorant, myself included, was convinced by the media and my peers that it was worthless and stupid of anyone to continue to hold it. Around this time, most of my initial purchase was sold off and I only continued to hold a half a dozen or so.
  

  
Sadly, it took Bitcoin reaching 20k to convince me that I needed to really learn what the hell I had been dabbling with all these years. I was already experienced in major crashes at this point so large pullbacks were not as terrifying for me. When Bitcoin fell back below 6k I finally put my convictions into overdrive and went off the deep end with accumulation, and education. Not only was I full steam ahead with Bitcoin, but I needed to know everything I could about alts.   


Since then my commitments clearly paid off. Not just financially, but I can't begin to breakdown how much Bitcoin has taught me about computer science, psychology, sociology, economics, governance, and more. It even taught me I didn't know jack shit about that paper money in my pocket. The more I learned about Bitcoin and related popular networks the less I cared about the price swings. Take it from my initial mistakes, don't touch your holdings. Instead, use each network, join the related communities, start building and make friends with other builders. Ignore price, keep focused on the fundamentals that drove your initial interest in whichever network. Most of all, don't concern yourself with ANY trending news. All this news Reddit or any social media thinks is concerning for Bitcoin/Ethereum/ and many alts means nothing. No one or no country is going to stop this train. You can't stop digital information sharing between humans. The world's first truly sound &amp; publicly run monetary systems and decentralized computational networks are only going to continue to eat away at the world's wealth. The fact that all blockchains combined are worth less than half one U.S. company, Apple, means we are still just getting started. Good luck everyone!

Obviously BTC and ETH are the top coins, closely followed by BNB thanks to Binance's restless round-the-clock works. I'll give MATIC a huge shout as the most used Ethereum sidechain.

Huge shout for oracles like LINK and DIA, their use in crypto and defi cannot be overstated.
OCEAN is gradually establishing themselves as masters of data economy on the blockchain, integrations and use transcends even beyond crypto to traditional/enterprise usage.
Layer 0s like Cosmos and Polkadot is making a good case for interoperability also and will play major roles in the future.

Then I'll say adoption of crypto depends a lot on how comfortable mainstream will be using it. To that end, stablecoins will play huge role, so issuers like Circle, Pax, Tether, e-Money should perform relatively well(for those with governance token like NGM for e-Money).
Also on this last point, payment platforms like Utrust, CDC, Binance pay, bitpay among others are also good for research.",1664759876,iqturuh,CryptoCurrency,2022-10-03 1:17:56,2

ggf31416,"Bitcoin mining uses SHA256 calculations, there is nothing that prevents running many such calculations in parallel.

A ""core"" can only run a single operation at one time. CPUs only have a few cores. Even a lowly RTX3050 has 2560 ""CUDA"" cores capable of general processing, albeit each one is slower than a CPU core, so a GPU can process parallelizable operations much faster than a CPU. A Bitcoin mining ASIC only has circuits to calculate SHA256 hashes, so they can run millions of calculations in parallel, so they will outperform any GPU.

ASIC resistant algorithms need a resource that can't be duplicated easily, e.g. Ethereum mining takes large amounts of fast memory, while GPU resistant algorithms use complex algorithms that GPUs are not good at.

As GPU miners recently discovered there only a certain amount of demand X for any coin, mining more won't magically increase the demand. With POW you basically get X * ( your_hashpower / global_hashpower) so it's almost pointless to mine with your CPU any coin that is not resistant to GPU mining as your individual contribution to hashpower will be insignificant.",1664751823,iqtcvii,CryptoCurrency,2022-10-02 23:03:43,1

Below is an argument written by jeff406 which won 2nd place in the Solana Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; As of May 2021, Solana's insider ownership is at 48% [\[source\]](https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1394283802009145348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1394283802009145348%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.coincu.com%2F47293-as-the-solana-ecosystem-grows-the-co-founders-address-financial-criticisms%2F). Among the crypto community, [critics allege](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=Solana%20pump%20and%20dump&amp;src=typed_query) that Solana is a pump and dump scheme being orchestrated by wealthy venture capitalists. While we cannot confirm or deny these allegations with 100% certainty, the amount of insider ownership is surely worrying. By investing in SOL, you are exposing yourself to the risk that these insiders could dump their coins on you.
&gt; 
&gt; Solana also doesn't have a great track record; In September 2021, the network had a [17-hour outage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/solana-network-of-top-10-sol-token-applies-fixes-after-outage). According to Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, ""Solana‚Äôs 'exclusive and closed set of servers' may be fast, but its value is no match for well-secured decentralized networks."" [\[source\]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/solana-network-of-top-10-sol-token-applies-fixes-after-outage)
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, in November 2021 [it was discovered](https://twitter.com/CryptoWhale/status/1457031472938893322) that Solana lied about their supply when an audit revealed an additional 12M coins.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite Solana's cheap fees and high transaction throughput, there are many events which bring the developers' credibility into question. For this reason, I intend to stay away from Solana.

Below is an argument written by LargeSackOfNuts which won 1st place in the Solana Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Solana claims to be an Ethereum killer. 
&gt; 
&gt; Its transaction costs are far lower than Eth's gas fess which does position the currency to be competitive. A typical Sol transaction costs around $0.00025, with a promise that it will not go above $0.01 [source](https://solana.com).
&gt; 
&gt; This is better than the $50 gas fees for a simple transaction on Eth's network.
&gt; 
&gt; Solana's website claims: ""Not only is Solana ultra-fast and low cost, it is censorship resistant. Meaning, the network will remain open for applications to run freely and **transactions will never be stopped**.""
&gt; 
&gt; Yet Solana couldn't handle high usage of the network, and the network was forced to shut down in January 2021 and September 2021. [source](https://itsblockchain.com/solana-mainnet-shutdown/) 
&gt; 
&gt; This raises major questions about the network as a whole, such as, can the network be forced to shut down again? Is the network so centralized that it is easy to get the major validator nodes on board with new changes? 
&gt; 
&gt; This also raises questions about just how much power the Solana Foundation holds over the network as a whole.
&gt; 
&gt; This problem is compounded by the fact that Solana's network of nodes is not truly decentralized. Currently, 19 nodes control over 33% of the network, which means only 19 people/entities would need to collude to change the network/blocks/transactions. [source](https://solanabeach.io/validators)
&gt; 
&gt; The centralization of the nodes is not helped by the barriers which the Solana Foundation has made for more validators to join the network. Each validator needs at least 1 Sol per day for voting requirements, so at least $176 per day, plus the extra costs associated with running a node.
&gt; 
&gt; There is no maximum supply for Sol. Inflation will provide monetary gain for validator nodes, but it dilutes the total amount. 
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, Solana does have low fees, but at the cost of a highly centralized, inflationary, controllable network of nodes.

Below is an argument written by samuelshix which won 1st place in the Solana Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #Enter the Solanaverse
&gt; In July we saw Solana moon from $24 to $197 in September, bringing it all the way from the backwaters of mid cap territory to the highly coveted Top 10 of cryptocurrencies. Why? On a fundamental basis, Solana shines when it comes to its **technology** and its **ecosystem**, the two most important aspects when evaluating the value of a network. Its website claims to have solved the Trilemma of scale, security, and decentralization, which we'll also dive in here.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Background
&gt; The Ethereum network has become extremely congested due to the explosion of DeFi activity on the blockchain. It's failure to scale to meet this activity has allowed the space to be filled by more scalable layer 1 solutions like Binance Smart Chain. But BSC still leaves a lot to be desired because of its centralization. This is where Solana comes in, a Proof of Stake layer-1 blockchain that has witnessed an explosion in interest because of its extremely fast speeds and low transaction costs, in addition to its relative decentralization. It now has over 350 projects built and counting, with one of the most active developer communities in the space.
&gt; 
&gt; ##  The Trilemma
&gt; Like many other protocols, Solana uses PoS to validate transactions, but what is unique to Solana is it use of Proof of History. In order to reach consensus on the network, validators use time to agree on the legitimacy of a transaction. This allows Solana to have fast and scalable transactions without sacrificing decentralization. There are other novel solutions that Solana introduces such as the first parallel smart contracts run-time (Sealevel), and Turbine, which is inspired by BitTorrent to allow Solana to help quickly ""propagate large amounts of data to a large number of peers."" These and five other innovations, which you can view yourself with a quick google search, allow Solana to have extremely low transaction costs and sub-second transaction times. It reached 50,000 Transactions per second on its testnet, and was able to prove its speed for the year or so that it's been live with 2000-3000 TPS, much faster than most others. This speed scales with internet speeds, so this will be even faster in the future, especially in conjunction with SpaceX's Starlink constellation providing unparalleled internet speeds in the future, which could theoretically lead to a 710k TPS based on a speed of just 1 Gigabyte/Second.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Counterpoints to decentralization and security
&gt; Lets start with decentralization. Many may point out that Solana isn't very decentralized, with 19 validators controlling 33% of the network. This is true. But Solana is still a lot better than competitors with similar speeds, like BSC, and as Solana expands with more validators, it will become more and more decentralized. Someone earlier posted a concern about Solana's centralization, but they mentioned 11 validators controlling 33% of the network, we've improved markedly since then.
&gt; 
&gt; Onto security. That 400k TPS attack we saw which shut down Solana's network for under a day is a huge problem. I agree, but I want to say that number one: problems like these are essential for the growth of the network as it reveals crucial problems to be solved; number two: Solana's hugely active development community will inevitably solve this security flaw and are working on it right now; and three, this is what the cost of fast development looks like. Cardano uses Peer Reviewed papers to inform its development, but that has caused development to be extremely slow. Solana development was much quicker, allowing it's Defi space to have longer to grow and mature.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Community
&gt; As mentioned earlier there are 350 projects built on Solana, one of the fastest growing communities in the space with a large number of active developers.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a growing interest in NFT videogames in the cryptocurrency space, with evidence that this segment will be the ""next big thing"" to happen to crypto, so to speak. There are a multitude of highly ambitious, highly anticipated games being developed on all kinds of networks, but I believe Solana provides the best environment for this. It's cheap, lightening fast transaction times are necessary and critical for a smooth, quick gaming experience.
&gt; 
&gt; The Solana ecosystem is backed by SBF Alameda, a high profile cryptocurrency figure and founder of FTX, one of the fastest growing exchanges in the world. The credibility of the man itself would be enough for many to hop on the SOL train.

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Maleficent_Plankton which won 1st place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Ethereum has drastically changed in the past year now that it has rebranded itself as **Consensus/Settlement layer** for other Layer 2 Execution/Rollup networks. It is no longer trying to be a monolithic blockchain by itself. Because of this shift in design, many of its former CONs are no longer major issues. And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.
&gt; 
&gt; I discuss the CONs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:
&gt; 
&gt; ## CONs
&gt; 
&gt; **Gas Fees** (major):
&gt; 
&gt; The biggest complaint for Ethereum is its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it's the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it's often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin's native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees.
&gt; 
&gt; Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021.
&gt; 
&gt; And that's just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can't be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It's impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees.
&gt; 
&gt; In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum's account-based model compared to Bitcoin's and Cardano's UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks.
&gt; 
&gt; **Competition from other Smart Contract networks** (moderate):
&gt; 
&gt; Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano?
&gt; 
&gt; Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum's Layer 2 rollup solutions will be.
&gt; 
&gt; **Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions** (major):
&gt; 
&gt; Ethereum's long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions.
&gt; 
&gt; These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users.
&gt; 
&gt; Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they're stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption.
&gt; 
&gt; Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won't be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses.
&gt; 
&gt; Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there's always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers).
&gt; 
&gt; **ZK Rollups** require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors** (moderate):
&gt; 
&gt; The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it's a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won't merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don't know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don't know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks.
&gt; 
&gt; **MEV and Dark Forest attacks** (minor):
&gt; 
&gt; [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners.
&gt; 
&gt; **Final Word**
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network.

CointestAdmin,"#Bitcoin Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by debeezneez which won 1st place in the Bitcoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Once it is more widely accepted, Bitcoin will be the first complete currency human beings have ever had. Fiat doesn't have limited supply, gold doesn't have portability, proof of stake coins don't have durability. Bitcoin is only missing acceptability as a key component in a currency, and that is rapidly changing with increased adoption.
&gt; 
&gt; Even with a market cap of nearly 1 trillion dollars, bitcoin is extremely low in market cap compared to its potential. Some people expect that a sub billion dollar marketcap is the only way to make 100x, but that only relevant to coins that will top out in the billions. With the probable future of bitcoin being the worlds strongest currency, its value in TODAYS society is upwards of 100 trillion dollars (more on this later). In a future society that has had the benefit of using history's best monetary network, the potential market cap of bitcoin is indescribable.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite often being called 'slow' when compared to other crypto based networks, Bitcoins development is optimized. You don't need to have layer one staking or smart contracts to fulfill the purpose of bitcoin. All that needs to happen is flawless protocol defence and network uptime. The tech is simple but the importance is vast, replicate the factors of hard money in a digital space, forever. 
&gt; 
&gt; Doing so in a decentralized manner ensures that Bitcoin is strengthened with every blow. The network is so reliable that it pays more to support it than it does to attack it. So when China bans mining, America buys asiics. When someone tries to acquire all the coins, the price chases them up. There are no individuals to prosecute so you have to attack the network head on, and market participates are enticed to learn from each attack.
&gt; 
&gt; This is why regulation will hurt everything else but help the bitcoin network. No matter what the technology is or who uses it, if the government has a point of attack they will exploit it. Ethereum currently won't succeed without the vast changes being implemented by the ethereum foundation. That is a vulnerability. Fiat won't succeed without the federal government. That is a vulnerability. Bitcoin won't succeed if 51% of a largely spread group of financially successful people are somehow coerced to all betray themselves at the same time. That is not a serious vulnerability.
&gt; 
&gt; BUT HEY! You made a lot of assumptions!
&gt; What if Bitcoin doesn't become widely accepted?
&gt; Bitcoin is superior at all the other aspects of money. (Durability, Portability, Divisibility, Uniformity, Limited supply). People are going to want to own it and eventually want to spend some. If you don't accept it as payment but it is popular, your competition will.
&gt; 
&gt; How is 100 trillion even a real number?
&gt; There is more than just the money in everyones savings account. People already know that fiat can be outpaced with superior assets, and the equity market is estimated at around 300 trillion dollars today. None of those options have as many monetary aspects covered as bitcoin does.
&gt; 
&gt; Why would anyone new buy it if you can't yield farm shit coins?
&gt; Jokes aside, the purpose of bitcoin is to preserve purchasing power, which is does almost flawlessly. Everyone is going to want this ability for a large portion of their capital eventually. Other protocols are acting sort of like a bank when they run defi. Its really you lending your purchasing power to an actor for credit. Its pretty neat but not revolutionary just because its on blockchain. 
&gt; 
&gt; How is it decentralized when michael saylor owns it all?
&gt; Two part answer. The network is secured not just by holders but by nodes and miners. Microstrategy will get large returns for taking a large risk if bitcoins price goes up, and that is perfectly fair. But as they buy more and more, it is going to cost more and more, where every other financial system in history has had some sort of corruption in its growth from unequal opportunity. As of today and as of 10 years ago, you and apple have the same purchase price.
&gt; 
&gt; Don't hate on ETH, why can't something newer take Bitcoins place?
&gt; Other blockchain technologies are cool, and may create super awesome internet, banking and ownership applications. But none of these things could ever replace bitcoin without copying its protocol. Its set up just right for maintaining integrity over time as a currency. If ETH did so, it would just be bitcoin #2 with a lower market cap and thus less security. So other coins are not a threat at all to bitcoins future utilization/ceiling. They do take some of the speculative dollars away from bitcoin, which I think is why alts are more volatile in price.

There's an inherent level of trust in any oracle system, and I think high-value / high-trust scenarios are better solved with DIDs than ""trust me bro, multiple sources"". 

For anything important, one credible source is usually worth more than 100 randoms on the street giving the same answer. Why do you ask a doctor, or an accountant, or a lawyer?

Chainlink seems suitable for low-trust, low-value, convenience. It's hard to justify paying fees to use and that's not great for the bags of LINK waiting to be sold off.

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 2nd place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #Ethereum Con Argument 
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclosure: I currently hold a position in ETH, ~53% of my current portfolio value*
&gt; - Tweaking my argument from [the last round](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pz4vav/rcc_cointest_top_10_ethereum_conarguments_october/hq6gy23/) 
&gt; - ETH has been the subject of a lot of criticism over the years and the same points still seem to get recycled ([premine/founders](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owypvc/my_personal_investigation_into_ethereum_uncovers/), [DAO rollback](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao), [scalability/centralization](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qw2e32/eth_is_bad_and_i_am_tired_of_pretending_its_not/hl0bqo9/), [inflation/supply](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-ethereum)). There are a ton of rebuttals online for the most common Con arguments - [see here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/najp2c/addressing_common_criticisms_about_ethereum/) and [here](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) for a start. 
&gt; 
&gt; - That being said, there are definitely some legitimate concerns about ETH to consider: 
&gt; 
&gt; ##Gotta pay the troll toll
&gt; 
&gt; - As a protocol, Ethereum is an '[empire](https://www.finder.com.au\/brave-new-worlds-cosmos-blockchain-and-social-evolution)', a self-contained ecosystem with [composability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- But the downside of a 'one chain to rule them all' approach is that it locks users into using the system and paying gas fees in ETH. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) is certainly an industry standard, but [interoperability](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/why-is-interoperability-important-for-blockchain) may be crypto's future. As Do Kwon of LUNA said recently: ""[Maybe it's a bad idea to stick all the applications into one global computer. Maybe it just makes sense to have a multi-chain future.](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1439969124550119431)"" Vitalik agrees, [but differentiates between a *multi-chain* vs. a *cross-chain* future](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrngyk8/).
&gt; 
&gt; - We all know [gas fees](https://www.gasprice.io/) on ETH are a pain in the ass. 
&gt;     -  A lot of complaints about gas are misguided or uninformed, not understanding the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition), mistakenly believing EIP1559 was supposed to lower gas fees (vs. [making them more predictable](https://pintail.xyz/posts/gas-market-analysis/)), or suggesting that ['gas fees are high, no one will use Ethereum'](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qikr7r/a_10k_eth_is_not_unrealistic_it_is_inevitable/hik9pet/). 
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High gas fees are in fact an indication of usage, of [people competing to use the chain](https://cryptofees.info/) - but this makes ETH a victim of its own success.
&gt; 
&gt; - Paying [$20 for a token transfer or a Uniswap trade](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) is just not feasible for users with less capital - [they get priced out of using the chain](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdi9i8/ive_tried_to_use_ethereum_1015_times_over_the/).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- A really interesting article dives deeper into how ""[people are entirely 'locked out' of their funds since it‚Äôd cost more in transaction fees to move the funds than the funds are actually worth.](https://medium.com/geekculture/value-fragmentation-8c8336f97cfd)"" At the time of writing the total 'lost value' of ERC20s was $600M, which doesn't include ETH itself or NFTs. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Which brings us to competition and scalability:
&gt; 
&gt; ##I drink your milkshake
&gt; 
&gt; - Having prioritized decentralization and security at the expense of scalability, Ethereum is now [focused on rollups to meet demand](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html).
&gt; 
&gt; -  However, some users may not care about decentralization - they want to participate in DeFi, NFTs, etc. without paying an arm and a leg and will use BSC, SOL or [sidechains that don't inherit ETH's security](https://finematics.com/polygon-commit-chain-explained/).
&gt; 	- [Funds have migrated](https://ethhole.link/) over the past year from ETH [via bridges to L2s and other L1s](https://medium.com/etherscan-blog/ethereum-bridges-four-months-on-10ee36f889ae).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- [TVL on L2s has boomed](https://l2beat.com/) as users flock to platforms with [cheaper transactions](https://l2fees.info/). Polygon for instance recently [flipped Ethereum in daily active addresses](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/04/polygon-flips-ethereum-on-active-user-addresses/).
&gt; 
&gt; - Ryan Selkis of Messari explained some concerns around these trends, suggesting that ETH's position will eroded by competitors and/or cannibalized by L2s:
&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt;[""Decentralization (specifically political decentralization) and architectural soundness have become secondary properties at best and willfully ignored at worst in the mercenary dominant market of 2021. Not every new chain has tossed decentralization aside, but many have. Even if Ethereum manages to hold off its largest non-EVM rivals, it will leak value to the rollup chains it leans on for scalability. ETH sits at ~60% market cap dominance among Layer 1s. That will either fall below 50% in 2022, or its Layer 2 rollup tokens will eat into its growth. Maybe both.] (https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf)""
&gt; 
&gt; ##Points of failure?
&gt; 
&gt; - While I agree with [this article debunking the ""ETH is centralized"" mantra](https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-isnt-decentralized-and-other-myths-ef2d132ee1fe), I think Ethereum still has some progress to make on the [**sociopolitical** and **architectural** aspects of decentralization](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274#.355j5eg0v):
&gt; 
&gt; - **Sociopolitics**:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- Vitalik is a great steward of the project and has been [trying to remove himself as a single point of failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x1b_S6Qp2Q&amp;t=656s). Anyone remember the [Vitalik death hoax?](https://fortune.com/2017/06/26/vitalik-death/)
&gt; 
&gt;         - But as a 'high priest', Vitalik's [vision](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html), [proposals](https://news.coincu.com/38718-vitalik-buterin-makes-proposal-eip-4488-to-lower-gas-fees-for-ethereum-layer-2-in-the-short-term/) and opinions have preeminent influence and there's no doubt [he remains the 'face' of Ethereum](https://time.com/6158182/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-profile/). The community looks to him for key communications like [roadmap updates](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1466411377107558402).
&gt; 
&gt;         * While [Ethereum development functions as an open source collaboration](https://media.consensys.net/ethereum-2-0s-latest-strides-forward-13f63652e57d?gi=30830fb85bbd), I think there are a lot of benefits to having a pseudonymous, 'absent' founder like with Bitcoin and Monero. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - There are also some concerns in my mind about the role of Joe Lubin and ConsenSys in [privatizing what should arguably be public goods](https://saitoofficial.medium.com/the-infura-problem-fe68866484ec). 
&gt; 
&gt; - **Architecture**: 
&gt; 
&gt;     * ConsenSys has been a huge player in [driving enterprise adoption](https://consensys.net/blog/news/consensys-acquires-jpm-quorum/) - but they also own [key Ethereum infrastructure like Infura and MetaMask](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/02/consensys-shareholders-readying-legal-action-over-share-valuation/). They're now being [audited for letting banks like JPMorgan Chase get a piece of the pie](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blockchain-company-consensys-faces-multi-billion-dollar-audit-as-shareholders-claim-board-breaches-fiduciary-duties---attributed-to-arthur-falls-301493433.html).
&gt; 
&gt;      - [Crypto Twitter](https://twitter.com/infura_io/status/1499446959827931175) seemed surprised to learn that MetaMask and Infura aren't actually permissionless [when users in some countries lost access](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/136336/a-look-at-metamask-infura-opensea-and-the-countries-they-do-not-serve).
&gt; 
&gt;      - Bigger incidents like [Infura going down](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereums-infura-iating-outage-revives-decentralization-concerns) or the [Geth bug causing a chain split](https://decrypt.co/79597/ethereum-blockchain-splits-software-bug-network) highlight the Ethereum network's reliance on this infrastructure. 
&gt; 
&gt; 		
&gt;     - Meanwhile client and hosting diversity remains an issue [(1)](https://mirror.xyz/jmcook.eth/S7ONEka_0RgtKTZ3-dakPmAHQNPvuj15nh0YGKPFriA) [(2)](https://clientdiversity.org/) as of writing:

Below is an argument written by ExchangeEnough7821 which won 2nd place in the USDC Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **What is USD coin (USDC)?**
  
&gt; USD coin is a stablecoin, first announced in May 2018. It is developed by the Circle Consortium - a partnership between the company Circle and the exchange Coinbase. Circle and Coinbase are responsible for issuing the USD coin, and Centre develops the technology behind and the framework of it. Circle is a company founded in 2013 by Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville, and is an official Money Transmitter ‚Äì it must comply with federal law and regulations. Now, it has over 60 partners and is continuing to expand.
  
&gt; Uses of USD coin:
  
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Avoid inflation in countries with weak economies
  
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Send money around the world without large fees, securely and instantly
  
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Short other coins without having to convert to fiat
  
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Buys things in crypto based apps and websites
  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Cons of USD coin** :
  
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Although the cost of transferring USD coin may be less than if it were fiat, when the Ethereum network is congested it can get very expensive to transfer even a small amount
  
&gt; 
  
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Although USD coin can be use in some DeFi apps and games, there are very few day-to-day uses for USDC ‚Äì there is almost no shops, restaurants or companies that will accept it in everyday circumstances, reducing its usability 
  
&gt; 
  
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Staking USDC can be risky compared to holding fiat in a bank ‚Äì banks have FDIC insurance and your money is almost guaranteed to be safe, albeit with a lower interest rate, but there are many examples of DeFi apps that have been hacked with funds drained so your money is in more danger
  
&gt; 
  
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Another issue that may put people off from USD coin is that it is centralised ‚Äì it is governed by Circle, so it the reserves cannot be verified, unlike decentralised options like DAI and SameUSD
  
&gt; 
  
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Although transferrin USD coin is very fast, certain fiat services -most notably PayPal ‚Äì have even shorter transfer times, sometimes 1 second or less
  
&gt; 
  
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Even though crypto is getting more mainstream with simpler apps, it can be difficult for many to understand how to use and stake this coin to achieve its full potential, and if it is held in private wallets and the seed key is forgotten there is nothing anyone can do to retrieve the funds, unlike apps like PayPal

&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Short other coins without having to convert to fiat
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Buys things in crypto based apps and websites
&gt; 
&gt; Pros of USD coin:
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	USD coin has many high value and reliable partneships with large firms, that gives the project stability and credibility. These include Goldman Sachs, Bitmain and IDG Capital, and these high profile links mean USD coin can be seen as trustworthy
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	Transfers with USD coin only take roughly 15 seconds, compared to the minutes it takes for a fiat wire transfer or similar ‚Äì this means it has a use case in transferring money across the globe quickly
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	The cost of money transfers remains the same no matter the size ‚Äì it is the Ethereum gas fee-, and this means for high value transfers it can be cheaper than other fiat versions, which may take a percentage
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	 Compared to the US Dollar, you can earn a much higher interest on the coin with decentralised apps, so is more profitable when holding than fiat currency.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	It is backed 1 to 1 with the US dollar ‚Äì one of the strongest and most reliable currencies in the world, so is also a very reliable stablecoin.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Ä¢	USD coin can be used by those who don‚Äôt have access to traditional bank account due to age or location, so can still cash out other coins into an exchange

Since our recent exchange collapses they are positioned to dominate the industry. All they need now is to fix or add a few things:

&amp;#x200B;

* Fix the ease of use for their advanced trading product. 
* Maybe some site-wide polish. Some re-designs wouldn't hurt. Since they merged Coinbase Pro their UI is weak and can be confusing to new users. Coinbase Pro was so much easier on the eyes before the merge. 
* Add more options for transferring coins that can be used on multiple chains. Let us choose which chain we want to use when transferring certain coins! Then make sure these options actually work (Looking at you Matic withdraw options).
* Start offering staking for all coins that support it and cut down the staking fees! 25% commission Coinbase? Really, Coinbase? Not sure why they lag so bad here. Staking is completely safe for them and their users. It's a huge draw for new investors and yet they take insane commission cuts and only support a few chains. Makes no sense. 
* Add additional 2-factor options like Kraken. Options for multiple keys and a master 2 factor key would be nice. More account security is sorely needed.
* Allow withdraws that don't batch transactions in a smart contract. Especially for Ethereum. Sometimes we need direct transfers!
* Better customer support and community communication. Coinbase... your support is nearly non-existent. You're a top exchange that is mostly seen as the safest crypto exchange in the world.

Sir-Tryps,"&gt;They‚Äôre both audited every month so unless one of the accountants is lying they‚Äôre both same dollar value per token.

Paxos attests (specifically not an audit) their holding every months. As does Circle. The issue is Paxos only does this for the busd that is minted on Ethereum. And any insurance provided also only covers busd on Ethereum.

Busd minted on binance chain is not guaranteed, insured, or attested by Paxos.

https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-and-paxoss-busd-high-quality-reserves-audits-and-regulation/

&gt;I can understand why they‚Äôd put on the BNB chain since it‚Äôs allegedly a lot cheaper and faster then Ethereum so it keeps their operating costs down when sending it between reserve and withdrawal wallets (I‚Äôll be honest don‚Äôt know this for sure since I‚Äôve never used the BNB chain, it‚Äôs what I found from a quick google search so take this with a grain of salt).

BNB is definitely faster and cheaper, but Binance shouldn't be able to do this, even if it cost 1 grand in gas fees and a month in waiting. If the coin is to much of a hassle then delist it. Saying ""oh these two completely different stable coins are basically the same so I'm going to convert them to my companies stables"" is how people get wrecked.",1671124706,j0cgjn5,CryptoCurrency,2022-12-15 17:18:26,2

Ethereum and other blockchains with smart contracts are very different, they have applications running on them like coin exchanges, lending/borrowing apps, nft exchanges, crypto games etc.  So, it has customers that buy Ether, the cryptocurrency, to pay the fees needed to use the applications on the blockchain.  In Q3 Ethereum brought in ~275$ mil.  At peak prices and activity in Q1 it was close to 2$bil.  I'd call that productive.",1672734797,j2qw2h2,CryptoCurrency,2023-01-03 8:33:17,2
jaaval,"There is nothing that makes centralized unsecure or decentralized secure. In fact, as I said, all the proof of work security stuff exists only because decentralization causes a need for it. It doesn‚Äôt make anything more secure. It is especially hard to hack any crypted system. Which is why hacks are not supercomputers breaking security or nerds on a console doing ‚ÄúVisual Basic GUI interfaces‚Äù. Hacks almost invariably target the users. They get you to give them the password. Blockchain doesn‚Äôt at all protect against this and because of its immutable nature if someone gets your password everything he does is now immutable. Bitcoin has been hacked thousands of times. People complain about hacks in ethereum chain all the time. Every time someone loses stuff in their account the system got hacked. That‚Äôs what hacking is. Blockchain special ability to prevent man in the middle attacks is just something it specially needs due to decentralization, that kind of attack is not actually hacking that happens in real world. 

Also, you are not obliged by the original contract. Contracts by definition only exist between the people who did the contract. Unless you signed the contract yourself no contract in upstream of ownership binds you in any way (and there is plenty of legal precedent about this).",1672732731,j2qtf90,CryptoCurrency,2023-01-03 7:58:51,1

$ETH is meant for L2's to consume as gas to secure their blockchains inside of Ethereum.

It's *not* meant for you to spend $40 in gas to mint an NFT with.

L2's are the 'use case protocols'. Instead of getting into a bidding war over the 15 TPS of blockspace on ETH, you pay the L2 to batch your transaction with 1000s of others, and the L2 gets into a bidding war on ETH to secure the entire batch of transactions.

If you had $100 of ETH a couple years ago it was enough to make 2-4 transactions, oftentimes not even 1. If you have $100 ETH today, on some L2's that's enough to make 20,000-40,000 transactions, oftentimes more.

So while ETH is more scarce, blockspace is NOT scarce anymore and 1 ETH will take you a lot further than before.

Fighting the FUD: @oganjastremski and I at @Frictionless_ have created a handbook to fight the FUD Solana faces constantly. We disprove the 4 main critiques of the network: Downtime Centralization Inflationary Tokenomics FTX Involvement

2. Downtime

Solana has had 99.6% uptime throughout its history while doing more true TPS than all other EVM chains combined There have been 4 outages total since 2020 Local fee markets, QUIC, and Stake-Weighted QoS with @jump_firedancer will reduce downtime to virtually 0

2. Centralization

Solana is objectively decentralized and censorship resistant, looking at full node count (3,474), or distribution of stake-weight and Nakamoto Coefficient (NC) of 30 vs. Ethereum's 2 Solana has achieved this degree of decentralization in less than 3 years

3. Inflationary Tokenomics

Solana has 4 main revenue paths to achieving profitability and long-term inflation rate of 1.5% Increase in network usage Priority Base Fees Local Congestion Fees Miner Extractable Value (MEV) It took ETH 7 years to be deflationary

4. FTX Involvement

Solana and FTX were first connected in 2020 when FTX was just beginning to enter the top 10 rankings of CEX volume FTX invested in the 5th round, after accredited retail investors on CoinList and 2.5 years after the project started

The new developments in Zero knowledge tech is very promising. I think it will be possible to integrate BTC on chains like Ethereum *natively* without trust assumptions some day.

The bad news is BTC needs to fork for it to be possible. The good news is it has to do this fork anyway to become quantum resistant, so it shouldn't be contentious to anyone - unlike the *war* trying to move it to POS would ignite.

You take the BTC protocol and put it inside of a ZK proof, upload the proof onto Ethereum (or onto any off-chain network) to interact with, then upload the new proof back to Bitcoin where the final outputs all play out. It will tear the walls down between blockchains and change how we use them. Ethereum in this case is the computer with Bitcoin acting as the settlement layer.

You could imagine someone wants to do this trade: BTC for AB-token, provide liquidity for 1 week, then output to a new BTC address. This will be possible without bridging, be safer than bridging, but will cost a little more than bridging. Your BTC transactions would only show you output 1 BTC into a ZKP address, and the ZKP address output 2 BTC back to a new address a week later. These higher fees will be good for miners and network sustainability, and with added complexity (on-chain scaling for payments via L2, privacy, decentralized/anon ID, data authentication) people shouldn't be upset to pay for it - considering how much some willingly pay to mint an NFT.

I don't know what the ideal outcome for BTC is but I don't think it's POS. Its whole *thing* is that it's POW, and the entire mining community is deluded into thinking they set the floor price with their energy costs (people really thought ETH would go to $0 after it went to POS). If it ever happened it would fracture BTC into two, one where mining persisted, and I'm not sure that accomplishes anything but weaken the security and trust(promise) backing BTC. It worked for Ethereum only because POS was the whole plan from the original whitepaper 8 years ago, and anyone who read into what they're buying had a clear idea it was going to happen (eventually).

After a few more halvings the POW energy problem will sort itself out anyway unless BTC is millions per coin by then. I don't think POW is inherently bad, but the immense growth BTC's price had in such a short time made POW into an immensely profitable *industry*, and their scale becomes a risk when the rewards go away. If BTC was still only $2K right now none of this would be industrialized or be of concern, and POW could still be achieved from home.. BTC is a failure of its own success. After a few more halvings, *most* of this new industry won't be in profit and will have to find a new money making scheme. Being the most secure network in the world by a wide margin I suppose with 5% as much energy going into it it's still probably more secure than it needs to be. It's something that needs to play out over time, but the outcome is far from certain.

I think POS is ideal myself but we already have Ethereum in POS. I think we are all on the same team here despite the infighting, so when the banks and governments inevitably come after *us* we need as many options as possible because none of them are perfect. You could mint $10T and buy up all the stake in Ethereum and brick the network, but you can't mint $10T and buy all the hashrate in POW. You can corrupt POW by threats or bribes as high energy consumers are easy to find, but you won't be able to physically find the people validating in POS. The more solutions we have at one time the more resilliant everything becomes. We just need to work on making it all interoperable with each other next so it's not *every chain for themself* when shit hits the fan.",1674267130,j587u4l,CryptoCurrency,2023-01-21 2:12:10,1

Whole_Visible,"It went pretty well because I first bought Doge early 2014 because I thought it was funny. Didn't have a lot of money until years later so could never buy in deep so I watched as things went wild in 2017 and made out of that largely unscathed because of my lack purchasing power. 2017-2019 bought a couple paychecks worth of crpyto. Then 2020/2021 even though I was monitoring crypto, I focused on stocks and made out well from my Dogecoin. Over the years tried various blockchains and if it supported DApps, then I tried those. Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Navcoin, Nano, Banano, Algorand, Tezos, Cardano, Polygon, Arbitrum, Solana, BSC, Vite, Tron, Stellar.

Focusing 2020/2021 on stocks, I enjoyed the fruits of my 2014 Dogecoin and what little I had bought 2017/2018/2019. 2021 I tried PlanetWatch which I made a marginal amount of profit on. Now I'm trying MapMetrics which I'm about halfway to break even with hopes that a bullrun would make it major. Great benefit is in the case of Dogecoin and PlanetWatch being early. Dogecoin and 2017-2019 coins, holding for years. Current coins, buying 2nd half 2022 is going well.

I think what will work out incredibly well in the future is that all the small toying with DApps in 2021 across chains will make me well capable to take advantage of whatever the changing narratives for crypto DeFi tokens there will be in a future bullrun. I'm focusing more on accumulating stocks and crypto now than at any other point in my life. You can add up the entirety of the 2010s and I've put more USD into stocks and crypto since September than that entirety of the 2010s.

So the centralized hosts, themselves, have nothing to lose by manipulating blocks or otherwise ruining the network.

Stratum v2 has just been released and has a higher barrier of entry than the easier Stratum v1, but adoption will obviously come... increasing Trust Minimization.  Foundry, the largest mining pool today, donated money for Stratum v2 development, so I'm quite sure they will be implementing it whenever they're ready.  One thing's for certain, tho... even if they didn't implement it \*and\* they reached 51% hashrate, there's ZERO chance they would sacrifice the price of the asset they're mining, after everybody involved, including themselves have sunken so much into money, time, energy, work, etc.  But Stratum v2 will definitely roll out amongst the larger miners when they feel the time is right.

* 
The contract will be maintained and upgraded via on-chain governance (AMP token holders)
